<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">Essential Features of Time Series Forecasting That Every Technologist Should Be Aware Of!</span>

People often find it difficult to forecast situations and predict the possible outcomes in various conditions. Suppose someone is going to invest/trade online, but it needs an extensive degree of prediction in the future market. On the other hand, there are so many industrial needs that require accurate diagnosis of upcoming weather conditions. Here comes the efficiency of modern-day **time series forecasting**.

We have seen several examples of problem-solving forecasting techniques, such as **stock forecasting** and **weather forecasting**. But in this section, we'll concentrate on the key concept of _**"time series forecasting."**_

## What exactly is Time Series Forecasting?

Time series forecasting is a strategy in which we observe the records over a certain period. One of the most fundamental time series forecasting examples is to check the climate variation based on day or month.

Let's have a look at how time series forecasting works and why it is becoming more popular in today's technological field.

It is sometimes difficult to differentiate between time-series forecasting and predictive algorithms that are based on machine-learning techniques. All machine learning algorithms, including <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/random-forest-model-rfm" target="_blank">random forest</a>, gradient-boosting, or regression neural networks, can be utilized to generalize the times series information.

However, the primary utility of time series algorithm is the ability to deduce patterns beyond the domain training data. Such data cannot be easily implemented by any machine learning algorithm.

While working with time series for rating, we need to keep a few points in mind. Those are:

1.  Quantity of Data

2.  Quality of Data

3.  Seasonality

4.  Trends

5.  Unexpected events/outcomes

### Quantity of Data  

The quantity of data is important in time series forecasting in order to produce an accurate result. A higher and more accurate amount of data equates to the better model prediction.

### Quality of Data  

Good quality data is usually defined as non-replicated and authorized data. It helps in prioritizing the quantity of data sets, which assists in delivering precise and accurate results in a predictable span of time.

### Seasonality  

Seasonality is an essential factor in time series forecasting, which helps in identifying the constant irregularities in the data sets over a period of time.

Let's understand this with an example:-

Suppose a grocery store delivers the result with a high selling situation during the festive season; on the basis of this we can conclude the irregularities of data using such incidents, which can be quite effective in detecting customer behavior on shopping trends.

### Trends 

Trends can be regarded as one of the most crucial elements in characterizing the onset and progression of time series data. This could be anything, including sales, institutional data, etc.

Seasonality, or data inconsistency across a specific period, can only be the reason that can affect trends data and result over a specific time period.

### Unexpected events and outcomes   

A range of organizational markets appears to be significantly impacted by unexpected events. An unexpected event could be anything, like a pandemic that lowers stock prices. Such occurrences are unplanned and challenging to manage. However, if we have a good understanding of managing probability, we can easily deal with the future outcomes.

## Types of Time Series Forecasting  

### Univariate:-   

It only has one data series and constant data categorical with a single variable.

### Multivariate:-

It has a diverse set of data for customer departmental and geographical sets with multiple variables.

## What is Time Series Decomposition?   

A decomposition is a type of model that enables the division of components into various patterns. This is helpful when designing a display with different patterns. The time series data is easily split up into different parts, each of which has an underlying pattern. By using the **decompositional** model, we can easily manage the above data sets.

**Here are the four components of the decomposition model:-**

**Tt:-**  _The trend component that examines the long-term development of time series forecasts._

**Ct:-**  _The repeated yet irregular fluctuations are reflected in the cyclical compositions at time t._

**St:-** _The term "seasonality" is used to describe the seasonal composition in time t._

**It:-** _It has been reclassified as the abnormal noise and influence at that particular time (t)._

In time series **decomposition** model, **classic**  **decomposition** is one of the most effective approaches. We divide them into two types of classical decomposition- **Decomposition** based on rate changes and **Decomposition** based on predictability. **This decomposition rate is further classified into additive or multiplicative.**

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/tfsm-4.png" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="A graph with X and Y axis shows additive decomposition with numerous analytical variations."/>

## Additive Decomposition:-   

Additive decomposition is one of the greatest approaches to time series data. We may infer that it can be extended in an additional component. The equation is written as follows:

<b>Tt + Ct + St + It = yt</b>

**Here 'yt' is represented as time series data.**

## Multiplicative Decomposition:-

Multiplicative decomposition is a model that employs multiplication instead of an addition to integrate the components of time series data. We can apply the multiplicative formula as follows:-

<b>Tt \* Ct \* St \* It = yt</b>

Now, many of you will wonder when to use an additive or multiplicative decomposition model, so the answer is very simple; it totally depends on the variety of time series models.

If the number of seasonal components fluctuates over time, we can implement the requirements of multiplicative models.

And if the seasonal component is constant over time, we can easily utilize additive models.

## Use cases of Time Series Forecasting:-  

- <b>Time series forecasting</b> helps in understanding the essential collection of data needed to interpret changes in the financial market.

- By evaluating financial data, experts may predict critical forecasts for financial applications such as risk development, effective pricing and trade, asset design, and so on.

- It has been a fascinating tool in the medical field. The massive amount of data generated daily can help in time series analysis which adds to human knowledge and information.

-  As technology has advanced, <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/artificial-intelligence-in-weather-forecasting-it-can-definitely-save-our-day" target="_blank">weather forecasting</a> has become more and more sophisticated with the touch of advanced time series forecasting.

- Apart from providing broad knowledge about the upcoming weather, today's forecasting technique is much more efficient in understanding the time and weather conditions more precisely.

- Time series forecasting helps in improving <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/time-series-forecasting-how-does-it-improve-business-decision-making" target="_blank">business decision-making</a> tactics and preparing for the probabilistic consequences that a firm may encounter.

- It aids in determining the risks and opportunities associated with the future plan's contingencies.

## What next?    

We can conclude that time series forecasting is an essential tool that helps in predicting future outcomes. It has numerous implications in areas like marketing, energy, aviation, etc. This is an important method for researching finance and economics.

So it's too critical to have time series forecasting knowledge to stay ahead of the hard job market competition. But thinking of where to learn? There are plenty of online and offline courses available. However, the most cost-efficient way is to pursue an <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/advance-data-science-certification-courses" target="_blank">advanced data science and AI course</a>. In short, a time series analysis course is not a good choice as the knowledge will be very limited to survive in the real-world requirements. Instead, choose a course that offers live classes, plenty of practical sessions, valuable capstone projects, and post-course job assistance.
