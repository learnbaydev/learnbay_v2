<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">Full stack software developer career can change the game for women in Tech</span>

When we talk about software developers, we hear famous names **MARTIN FOWLER, KENT BECK, GEORGE H. FAIRBANKS, MARK RICHARDS, UNCLE BOB,** and a few more. The tech industry is flooded with men. Most of them think that when it comes to software development or any other job role in the tech industry, it is only about men.

This is why we want to share with you and clear your thoughts that full-stack software is not just about men. In fact, it can change the growth direction of a woman's career no matter whether she has a career break or has an impressive career flow. Industry-paced full-stack developer courses are helping women to remove the gender gap in tech by assisting women in restarting their careers after a <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/full-stack-software-developer-course-the-guarantee-of-a-lucrative-career-restart-for-women-after-a-break" target="_blank">career break.</a>

In fact, we can say a full-stack developer's training is like a career booster for women professionals irrespective of their professional background, tech or non-tech. Alternatively, you can consider the data structure and the algorithm course too.
