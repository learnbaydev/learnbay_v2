<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">Introduction to AI and Human Behavior</span>

**Artificial intelligence (AI)** is an area of computer science concerned with the research and development of intelligent devices, such as digital agents and computer programs. Artificial intelligence is a broad word that can be used to refer to a variety of systems. However, because there are so many diverse characteristics of human intelligence with so many various applications, it's difficult to assign a single label to **intelligent behavior**.

**Humans** cope with knowledge in four ways:  **limited memory, theory of mind, spatial intelligence, and reactive intelligence**. It's not just about technology when it comes to AI. I **t is about the ability of machines to operate and process information without human intervention.**

Businesses and consumers look to be going in opposite ways in the past. While consumers have become more tech-savvy, businesses have slowly adapted to new technologies. In recent years, this has improved. Humans are teaching AI how to operate with (and on) them.

In this blog, we'll look at how Artificial Intelligence (AI) may detect defects in human behavior and utilize them to make decisions.

<a href="https://youtu.be/haaNnBmyRiM)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Artificial intelligence (AI)</a> has a lot of potential, but it also has a nasty side. This is why so much AI research is being done to ensure that the technology being developed is being used for the proper goals. AI can learn to discover vulnerabilities in human routines and behaviors and exploit them to affect human decision-making, according to a recent study. This is a fascinating breakthrough, and it exemplifies how artificial intelligence can be utilized for good.

**AI** is affecting society in a variety of ways. One of the profound effects is on the workplace. Artificial intelligence tends to reform human work. AI helps organizations work remotely. AI can also anticipate and optimize workflows, saving time and money. The majority of AI's effects are only now beginning to manifest, and they are expected to become more significant in the future.

## Will AI take over human thoughts?

Machines are becoming increasingly intelligent. They are now able to comprehend words and even learn from their errors. Machines already have the ability to interpret emotions and recognize human facial expressions, according to a recent artificial intelligence study.

Surprisingly, one research group discovered that machines can detect whether or not a phone call is a hoax. The advent of AI has enabled this <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/what-is-supervised-and-unsupervised-learning-in-machine-learning" target="_blank">machine learning</a> power. It's no longer only about computers when it comes to AI. It includes the ability to read people's emotions and facial expressions.

The recent disclosure of the unlikely scenario of a machine taking over the globe may appear alarming, but it isn't. There are numerous advantages to AI, and it is in our best interests not to try to stop it from growing without effective restrictions and a clear governance mechanism.

## AI and human consciousness :- 

It's not a question that can be objectively addressed, but it's a fact that machines will become smarter in the future years. It is critical to comprehend the differences between machine and human intelligence.

Now the debate is whether or not an intelligent computer can be deemed aware. Aside from specific responses, there are undoubtedly some continuous ground-breaking factors. Machines will never have consciousness in the technical sense. However, if machines begin to resemble humans, they can be termed intelligent, albeit without consciousness.

## Impact of AI on human behavior:-  

**What impact does AI have on human behavior? Is AI responsible for all the good and iniquity?** 

Certainly, we are all aware that AI is infiltrating every aspect of life, from our phones and laptops to our employment. **But, how can we introduce AI for a good purpose?** 

The <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CSIRO</a> ran a series of tests in which people were asked to play games versus a computer. We'll look at three of their experiments in this blog to see how they turned out.

The first experiment consisted primarily of red and blue-colored ball games, in which the AI learned the participant's patterns of choices and ran them, resulting in an accuracy of over 70%.

Participants in the second experiment were supposed to view a screen and hit a button when they saw a specific sign (such as an orange triangle), but not when they saw another (say a blue circle). The AI set out to arrange the symbols in such a way that the participants made more mistakes, and it succeeded by about 25%.

The third experiment is basically related to the fund investment process, where the machine is a trustee and the humans are investors, with the AI learning how to encourage the participant to give the investor (itself) more money by monitoring how they opted to disperse their false currency.

As we conclude the experiment. We may deduce that the machine picked up on every trend in the human reaction and exploited flaws in people's decision-making processes. The system eventually learned to direct participants toward specific actions as a result of the experiment. These studies are truly beneficial in the actual world and have made a significant advancement; with the passage of time, technology will be polished and will undoubtedly bring more and better AI decision-making and human behavior.

## AI developments that make it simple to manipulate people's behavior:-  

**Deep Learning and computing power**

In order to construct well-accepted programming that can accurately mimic human behavior and remember it, deep learning and cloud computing are both crucial components of intelligence. The intersection of these two phenomena has led to the most promising advancement in artificial intelligence, deep learning.

Cloud computing and deep learning are two of artificial intelligence's most promising advances. Deep learning's capabilities are linked to the internet, making it a tremendously resource-intensive computing undertaking. **Artificial neural networks, which are used in deep learning, may handle complex problems. Deep learning is capable of solving problems in ways that standard programming is unable to.**

## AI chips:-  

 AI is at its pinnacle right now. In fact, increasing the effectiveness of an AI model may not even be possible with the most advanced CPUs. To use AI for tasks like **computer vision, natural language processing,** and **speech recognition** , businesses need high-performance CPUs. In essence, this AI device improves CPU efficiency. Additionally, they support the analysis and interpretation of the challenging data needed for inference. As the chip is AI-enabled, it likely intervenes in the prior scenario and adjusts all the parameters so that it becomes relevant to the person on every usage.

## Final thoughts:-

We hope you enjoyed our blog post about AI's advantages. We want to emphasize that AI may be utilized for a variety of positive reasons and can also assist us in solving many of the world's problems. We eagerly await your feedback on this article so that we can improve our understanding of AI's benefits. AI has huge potential to evolve the universe, and this shift would lead to tremendous innovation; yet, AI development is still in its early phases, and we might easily declare that AI is the future.
