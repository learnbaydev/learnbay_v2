<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">Robot Chefs Are the New Horizon of High-Demand Restaurants…No More Order Delays…</span>

Have you ever considered having your food prepared by a robot chef? Many contend that this concept is impractical and unrelated to reality. But the recent invention has thrilled the world by creating an AI-bot chef, which mimics and cooks food like a top-rated human chef. In fact, such innovative robot chefs are available in India too.

## What is a 'Robot Chef'?

The robot chef is a robotic system that can work as a chef in a restaurant, clean the kitchen, and prepare edible snacks. All it requires is a power source and a supply of raw materials. Having a robot that can do the work of multiple people would relieve human pressure in the restaurant industry.

## How's that feasible?
 
Let's face it: using artificial intelligence is now standard practice. Some people believe that AI will eventually defeat humans. In fact, <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/did-you-know-artificial-intelligence-can-manipulate-human-behavior" target="_blank">artificial intelligence can now manipulate human behavior</a>. But what if there was an AI robot chef who could make anything you wanted in a quick span of time?

### Know the first kitchen robot- 'Moley'   

The invention of the robot chef is not a new idea; Moley Robotics, a company that came to life out of the collaborative and inventive minds of futurists, engineers, and culinary specialists, was creating kitchen robots that are going to change cooking experiences for humans around the globe. The first chef-robot is named Moley, which has been integrated with advanced technology that allows him to execute his own recipes and experiment with varying ingredients and styles.

The goal is for Moley to revolutionize how human beings cook their foods - potentially expanding their expectations about what it means to be a professional chef or giving them new levels of taste and appeal in the comfort of their homes!

## Can robot chefs replace human chefs?   

The advancement of robotics in modern human kitchens is astounding. We anticipate that very soon, both restaurants and homes will have robot chefs in their kitchens, able to prepare delectable meals when requested without the need for repeated asking.

Restaurants today are utilizing technology to cut down on high costs from labor. Many of these restaurants have started using POS systems or online food ordering applications such as GrubHub, AR-based software that provides customers with pictures and videos from their phones, allowing them to see their meal prepared in full view virtually, and other technological systems that are making meals more enjoyable for everyone involved!

But if we draw a further conclusion, it becomes clear that humans cannot be replaced because robotics and AI both have their limitations and are inherently brittle. They can only be utilized to facilitate human endeavors.

Here the biggest concern is the robots do not have taste buds. But yes, advancements are still there. A group of scientists from Frontiers in Robotics & AI experimented on it through their 'taste as you go' robot. Such robots can create a taste map from different samples. But still, we have to go long. So as of now, we can say robot chefs can't replace human chefs.

## Sensors on which robot chef works:-   

Robots use sensors for different sorts of situations. As a result, expanding the use of sensors is crucial to minimize uncertainties and enhance production. We will briefly review seven common robot chef sensors in this article.

 **Several characteristics that describe a sensor's capabilities are used to define it-** 

- Sensitivity

- Linearity

- Response Time

- Range of dynamic and measurement

- Accuracy

- Repeatability

- Resolution

- Bandwidth

## Seven typical sensors that are used in robot chefs:-  

### I. Noise detector:-  

Typically, sound detectors are microphones that convert specific frequencies into voltages. The microphone's frequency must be carefully calibrated to generate a measurable change in voltage using sound. This process is called calibration, which ties in directly to the amount of voltage produced.

Electronics and speakers use this concept of calibrating frequencies to ensure proper connections with each other. Microphones are also used in voice recognition systems that occur through the use of robots and computer interfaces. These robotic chefs make it simple to recognize and understand customer voices, which aids in their training in accordance with the restaurant's conditions.

### II. Proximity sensor:-

Proximity sensors serve as a convenient method for robot chefs when managing collisions. Such a proximity sensor helps the robot chefs to sense the presence of any object. Support when the robot is within the touchable distance of a spoon. It will proceed to grab it. Similarly, the robot will light the fire only when it's within reachable distance of the same.

### III. Tactile sensor:- 

Force and touch sensors are the two primary categories into which these sensors fall. They allow an object to understand its environment and are frequently employed by commonplace products like elevator buttons that change brightness when touched, lamps that change color according to how hard they are pushed or shaken, etc. A device that simulates human touch with the environment is referred to as a tactile sensor.

Touch sensors are frequently used in robotic chefs to enable basic movement and detect a touch in the surrounding environment. For example, such a sensor helps a robot chef to sense the exact pressure needed while cracking an egg or white knitting a flour dough. In fact, due to highly precise tactile sensors, a robot chef can perfectly hold a fork or a cooking spatula.

### IV. Temperature detector:-    

Temperature sensors detect the temperature around them by sensing the difference in the amount of current from one side to the other. This measurement is then converted into a number and reported to you in a readable format. Temperature sensing has many applications, including being able to monitor air, surface, and immersion temperatures for different purposes.

Robot chefs can efficiently keep an eye on the temperature and power safety of the cooking equipment while preserving the safety of the food in accordance with that food temperature sensor. In fact, it can also identify the right and soothing temperature of a dish before serving.

Thermocouples, which have both industrial and medical uses for temperature measurement, are one of the most popular forms of temperature sensors available today.

### V. Position detector:-        

Utilize the information that has been processed to estimate the robot's approximate position, velocity, and other pertinent details required to carry out commands and complete challenging tasks within a given range; this position sensor is used to determine the robot's location.

Robotic chefs can use such technology to get ahead of the line when someone orders. They can use this detector to reach them and take orders directly from the customers.

The most frequently used location sensor is the GPS or Global Positioning System. Robots emit messages over a network of satellites orbiting our globe, and receivers onboard these robots receive and analyze these signals to establish their whereabouts.

### VI. Accelerometer Sensor:-  

A device that detects acceleration, tilt, and velocity is an accelerometer. Static force (the friction created between two objects) and dynamic force are the two fundamental forces acting on an accelerometer (the acceleration needed to move an object).

An accelerometer can determine whether robot chefs are balanced or moving upward by detecting these forces. We can evaluate the wheel tilt of robots by using this data. To prevent a robot from toppling over, utilize this measurement. By gathering data on the robot's movement velocity, an accelerometer can also be used to gauge a robot's speed or acceleration.

So, these seven sensors are fundamentally necessary for any robot to perform its potential duties, whether as a chef or in any other automation. Making a superb AI robot chef requires all of these precise and essential sensors.

### VII. Salinity Sensor:-    

Whatever sensor you use in a robot chef, if you miss this one, then your robot will not be able to become a chef. Although not accurate as humans, still such a sensor helps the robot to check the saltiness, softness, or hardness, and texture of food particles.

## Final Thoughts:-

Here, we can affirm with ease that this Robot Chef exists, and with the aid of the AI and sensors mentioned above, we can quickly and easily enable robot Chefs for various tasks. At this point, it is clear that technology cannot replace human workers, but soon, AI will transform the world, and robot chefs will become more commonplace worldwide.
