<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">Is It Possible for Google to Detect AI-Generated Content?</span>

**AI-generated Content** has become a hot topic now. Although it's not new. In the last few years, there has been a lot of development in **automated content creation tools** like Pitcher, Copysmith, Wordsmith, Articoolo, etc. However, those could not offer the essence of human written content to the Google search Algorithm.

But what about **ChatGPT** the most talked about topic in the last few months!!!!

_Can Google detect ChatGPT-generated content?_

Well, the answer is yes; Google can detect ChatGPT-generated content, also. Although Google is not completely against AI-generated content (as per official sources), Google still considers the missing human touch as the content quality degradation factor, which affects the ranking to a great extent.

**But how can Google detect AI-based content? Let's dive into the AI content a bit.**

## What is AI-generated Content?

The AI-generated content typically works on a segment where all the content, blogs, or any written documents is thoroughly entailed by AI-based tools. Additionally, AI (Artificial Intelligence) based technology has also gained the ability to create AI-generated images and videos which look alike a human-made sketch or editing.

Accordingly, ChatGPT has gained some popularity in this section; since its launch, it has gained diversified growth, and millions of users are attempting to use this technology.

And it becomes really difficult for a person to obtain a certain distinction between human-generated content vs. AI chatbot-generated content using ChatGPT.

 **How does Google act in or detect AI-based Content?**

It is a fact that Google can easily detect AI-based content. After a huge surge in **AI-generated content** creators in their platform, Google has set some measured rules and continuously tends to develop new algorithms to easily take down AI-generated Content.

_To learn and understand AI-generated content, Google is certainly using its algorithms to check the consistency and inconsistency in the writing patterns,_ which helps them to evaluate which content is AI generated and which is human-made content.

The Google algorithm attempt to search for the _sequences, sentences, and patterns which show meaningless phrasing which is not useful to human readers but has an exact keyword._

In addition, Google deploys two models to recognize AI-generated content.

<b>1. Stochastic Model</b>

<b>2. Markov's Chain Model</b>

### Stochastic Model:-  

A stochastic model is a tool usually used to evaluate and assess the probability distribution of various possible outcomes by allocating a random variation in more than one input over a specific period of time.

It aids in the enhancement and acceleration of a set of potential solutions. Stochastic models can undoubtedly enable prediction and forecasting based on increasingly complex data models and random variables under a variety of conditions.

### Markov's Chain:-   

Markov chain is another tool for predicting the probability of an event occurring, which is also determined as the subset of stochastic modeling.

The most common application of Markov chains is in website ranking. We can find the webpage when conducting different web searches using this method. It functions by linking the sites from other sites to check the state of the transition.

Additionally, it already contributes to disturbing after checking the tuning state. It basically helps in ranking and unranking websites that use **AI content creation tools**.

Various tools, such as gltr.io, originality AI, etc., can be used to find **AI-generated content** in a chrome extension. But apart from such extensions and AI tools, Google has enhanced its own algorithm and technology to take down the content generated by AI-based bots.


<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/hdg-3.jpg" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An illustration shows a bot detecting AI-based content on a mobile screen."/>


## Why is it necessary to detect AI-generated Content?  

There is yet no rule such as plagiarism or copyright laws in place for AI-generated content, but Google has stated that it will take aggressive action against such stuff. However, if there is any misguidance or contradiction in any content, Google can easily analyze the difference between human and AI-generated content using its <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ranking-systems-guide#reliable-information-systems" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reliable information system</a>.

Many universities, colleges, and organizations throughout the world are pushing to ban all AI-based content automation tools. The utilization of such AI-generated content has resulted in an unfulfilled and productive requirement of content for clients.

## Google's opinion on AI-generated Content:-    

-  According to Google webmaster guidelines, AI-generated content totally violates the rule and guidelines.

-  Google has introduced a manual penalty for content that comes under auto-generated content.

-  It violates and effectively decreases the website ranking if the content is not edited or as per audience requirements before the posting.

-  The content should include specific keywords, but it needs to be more precise and must show some sense to the reader.

-  Google is experiencing a variety of issues With AI writers producing massive amounts of text without any verification or consistency.

-  Google aims to offer customers high-quality content and relevant search results and consistently improve its ranking algorithms. Additionally, it provides different <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#spammy-automatically-generated-content" target ="_blank" rel="nofollow">references to information</a> that will be included in content marketing produced by AI.

## Risk of Using AI-generated content:-    

### Plagiarism Issue:-

AI-based content has plagiarism and quality concerns because the AI-produced tools are unable to interpret the text and information they generated to collect from the internet, and in some situations, it becomes difficult to read sentences or shows significant plagiarism in the content. We cannot rely on AI-based content to provide unique resources. Apart from that, there is no creation or engagement in AI-based content.

### Mis-guide and Irrelevant content:-

The content produced by AI can be essentially a source of unreliable outcomes; searching for every piece of content using AI may result in irrelevant/existing content because AI can only be effective with trained data sets.

### Robotic Tone:-  

Because AI is unable to generate new ideas, every AI-based content requires extensive human editing. Furthermore, because of the participation of software that is unable to distinguish between human and robotic language, the tone of the content sounds more robotic and unnatural.

So these are a few risks that may are included while implementing and generating content using AI-based tools.

## What are the scopes of AI experts in such a ChatGPT/AI-generated content scenario?

With the debut of ChatGPT, AI-based content has become the most popular thing; however, with the huge surge in use cases, AI-based content has also witnessed a sudden and huge downfall.

This is because of the new guidelines by Google and its updated algorithm, which results in the unranking of the website which uses AI-based content.

So AI experts can expect booming scopes from two sides. The first one regards the generation of high-end and search-engine-optimized **automated content generation tools.** The second one is highly precise AI-based content detection tools for maintaining search engine rank efficacy.

It might seem a bit tricky, but the upcoming AI job market is going to see limitless openings for such roles. And the most important thing is tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Meta are already onto it.

## How to become a demanding AI expert in such a scenario?  

While opportunities are kissing the sky, so is the competition. To stand out from the crowd and attract the recruiter's attention, you need an extraordinary level of AI expertise. The best way to achieve such a skill is to pursue an industry-ready <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/artificial-intelligence-certification-course" target="_blank">Advanced Artificial Intelligence Certification Course</a>, backed up by real-time <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/what-is-a-job-ready-capstone-project-and-why-is-it-important-in-ai-and-data-science-course" target="_blank">capstone project</a> experience and dedicated job assistance. This course focuses on advanced ML models and high-end database management training. These two aspects are the most important part of AI-content generation or detection tool development.
