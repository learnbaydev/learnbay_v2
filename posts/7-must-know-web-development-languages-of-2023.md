<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px"> Become an Expert Full Stack Developer by Mastering These Essential Web Development Languages </span>

Choosing a language to start a learning curve is tough for many full stack developers. A common question in everyone's minds is, 'which languages for web development are helpful to get hired in a top organization?' Many tech organizations are in dire need of truly expert full stack web developers.

These companies need full stack developers to help them tackle the most challenging scenarios in the field.

So, what puts full stack developers apart is their mastery of various web development languages. It's their proficiency in different languages that helps them find viable solutions to problems. So it's quite significant to know which languages are vital.

The massive number of programming languages available for web development makes web developers more confused. Most of them panic with the thought, 'Which language(s) to learn first or focus on?'

Here, I am going to help to figure out where to start to become a successful full stack web developer.

To start over, first remember each programming language has individual functions and advantages, which make the learning of a set of web development languages more significant than mastering only one.

There are 7 key languages of full stack web development, which is also referred to as the '7 Chakras of a full stack developer.'

## 7 Chakras of a Full Stack Web Developer

### 1. HTML

_'For the structure of the website.'_

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) displays documents in a web browser. A markup language describes how a web browser presents different types of multimedia, like text, graphics, etc., on a webpage.

The web development language, HTML, helps in creating pages for the web. In addition, it's easy to use and provides simple hashtags and designs for coders who can define web elements more efficiently.

The latest version is HTML5, which provides improved attributes and design for users to experience even better.

### 2. CSS   

_'Give style to the website.'_

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used alongside HTML to give web pages a more appealing layout, style, colors, and design.

CSS is an easy-to-learn language. As a result, it is one of the fundamental web development languages to study. However, to understand the basics of CSS, a full-stack web developer must first understand modern HTML.

CSS is related to web design. Without CSS, the website will be plain text on white background.

### 3. JavaScript   

_'Create a dynamic and interactive website.'_

Web browsers use JavaScript to create an engaging and vibrant venture for the user. However, its main use was just as a scripting language. But JavaScript now has applications as both a front-end and back-end language (Node.js).

JavaScript is used by web browsers to create an interactive and dynamic experience for the user. JavaScript enables animation, adaptive content, and on-page form validation for the first time.

Most of the modern advancement in the internet that makes it so powerful employs one or the other form of JavaScript.

Since it has usages in front and back-end development, you can modify the data handling methods. As a result, developers can optimize and create better codes thanks to built-in JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, etc.

Since its beginning, JavaScript has become a part of every web developer's toolkit.

**JavaScript can do the following:**

- _Autocomplete._

- _Loading a new range of data on the same page by skipping the re-loading of the page._

- _Rollover effects and dropdown menu._

- _Animate page elements like fading, resizing and relocating._

- _Video playback as well as audio playback._

- _Validate input from web forms._

- _Repair browser compatibility issue._

### 4. Python   

_'Most popular language for Back-end Development.'_

<a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/introduction-to-python-programming" target="_blank">Python programming</a> is a popular language for beginners. It is user-friendly, clear, and intuitive syntax makes it easy to use.

Python has various applications. Since it is a universal language, Python provides a better option for web development use cases. As a result, Python is the main language for back-end development used in websites today.

Python provides various frameworks and libraries for developers. Many developers argue it to be the best language for web development and a must-have in every developer toolkit.

Python has an open-source back-end framework called Django, used in developing prevalent websites Spotify, Instagram, and Mozilla.

Other popular Python use cases include NumPy and SciPy packages used in the computer programming field. And libraries like TensorFlow, sci-kit-learn, PyTorch, and OpenCV are used for data science applications like machine learning.

### 5. Node.Js   

_'For traditional website and back-end API service.'_

Node.Js relies on Chrome V8, a javascript engine executing application code. It does not matter the type of browser or operating system; it can execute any application code. Node.Js is a standalone application since it's reliable and easy to use.

Node.Js is considered a full-stack JavaScript. A full-stack web developer can build both the server and client sites using Node.js. They may also build tools and utilities for every environment like OS, desktop, web, and others.

Node.js is a remarkable technology that offers an unbeatable and out-of-the-crowd user experience. Full-stack web developers consider it one of the most efficient cross-platform web development languages.

**Benefits of Node.js**

- _Create a Real-time application._

- _Simple and easy hosting._

- _SEO friendly._

- _Cost-effective._

- _Easy sharing._

- _Single code base._

- _Long-term support._

- _Deploy web apps with ease._

### 6. Express   

_'Back-end framework for Node.Js.'_

Express is a free and open-source language. This helps full-stack developers save tooling costs because most frameworks are not accessible these days. Furthermore, as this is open-source software, full-stack web developers worldwide contribute their works to Express. This makes Express a much better and more powerful language.

Express can create a high-performance web application. But in addition, it drives up the user experience. Full-stack web developers and technical experts understand user experience is vital for retention and repeat visits.

Express is a simplistic framework. It offers a thin layer of basic web app development features. And also includes high-quality code written by full-stack web developers. So, any full-stack web developer that works on Express in a project uses high-quality code, resulting in better performance.

### 7. MongoDB  

_'Create accessible and scalable web applications.'_

MongoDB can handle high-volume scalable data while managing large data loads. Its application is building internet and business applications, so it has evolved quickly.

Full stack web developers work with MongoDB for a lot of reasons. A few of them are as follows:

- MongoDB is the most wanted database in the world. It is easy for full-stack web developers to store, manage and retrieve data while creating applications.

- MongoDB is a pioneer today, what we call a NoSQL database. It's an improvement on the RDBMS systems based on SQL. The reason behind the same includes the non-supportiveness of fast development cycles, which is needed in present-day applications.

- Many systems in different businesses and functions utilize MongoDB. The reason is very simple. If you are dealing with long-standing data management problems, then nothing can beat the advantages of MongoDB.

**Benefits of MongoDB:**

- _Integrate large amounts of diverse data._

- _Describes complex data structure that evolves._

- _Deliver high-performance applications._

- _Support hybrid and multi-cloud applications._

- _Support agile development and collaboration._

## What does a Full Stack Developer do?  

Full-stack developers handle the user interface and the server side of a website's development. Due to this, they have quite a bit of responsibility to carry in the industry.

These are:-

- Design user interactions with front-end development code.

- Create and maintain databases and servers.

- Receive design handoffs from UX and UI designers and code the same.

- Testing and debugging both the front and back ends.

- Design and develop functioning APIs.

- Writing documentation.

- Work along with data scientists and analyze the data architecture.

- Stay updated with new technologies that improve technology and customer experience.
