<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px"> Google Bard vs. ChatGPT-4: A Comprehensive Evaluation!</span>

We all are familiar with the term ChatGPT. It gained huge popularity within a quick span of time. In addition to that, OpenAI's chatGPT has already advanced its GPT-3 model with a successor, **ChatGPT-4**.

The phrase '**ChatGPT-4**' is echoing everywhere. It has completely revolutionized the tech industry, and with continual upgrades, it has made it possible for humans to interact with AI in a more natural and spontaneous manner.

The discovery of ChatGPT-4 has haunted several tech giants, including Google. In addition to this, **Google unveiled Bard**, a new AI-designed Google chatbot to provide fierce competition to OpenAI.

Here, in the blog, we will discuss the differences between OpenAI ChatGPT-4 and Google Chatbot Bard; similarly, we will see which one form these two have a better comprehension of chatbot technologies.

## What is an AI Chatbot?

AI chatbots program basically runs on AI and <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/nlp-and-deep-learning-for-data-scientists" target="_blank">NLP</a> that take the input as a user query and provides optimized outputs.

In this regard, <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/what-is-generative-ai-all-you-need-to-know" target="_blank">Generative AI</a> is such a technology that can develop many types of virtual assistants and chatbots; in short, it could be the future of automated content-generation techniques. These Generative AI are mostly built on machine learning techniques, and both **Google Bard** and **ChatGPT-4** can utilize and implement this technique.

After the <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/openai-gpt-3-revolution-the-thrill-of-next-gen-ai-innovation" target="_blank">OpenAI's GPT-3 revolution</a>, there was a significant increase in the number of followers who intend to use the capabilities of this chatbot. After that, the 4th generation of GPT technology initiated another revolution. Professionals and students alike are incorporating the ChatGPT-4 into their everyday work activities.

However, the application of ChatGPT offers both advantages and disadvantages, and it cannot be used for a longer span of time. But due to high efficacy, it's become a threat to Google search algorithms, which introduced Google's competitive innovation- **Google Bard**.

But before going further, we must deeply understand ChatGPT-4 and Google Bard.

## What is Google Bard?    

**Google Bard**, a Generative AI-capable software incorporated by Google, uses a **Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA)**. It is a new chatbot algorithm model which uses the application and features that have been used by chatGPT.

The Bard has a restricted amount of searches and functionalities because the application is currently in beta testing. Google Bard aims to integrate the depth of human knowledge with its enormous data and massive language models.

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/gbp-3.jpg" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An image titled 'G BARD' shows the logo of Google and four chat bubbles."/>

## What is ChatGPT-4?  

OpenAI ChatGPT-4 tends to promote a language generation model, implying that text understanding is the same as humans. The ChatGPT can be refined and upgraded for each and every Natural Language Processing (NLP) based task.

We also know that ChatGPT can provide accurate and precise text-based answers, but sometimes it becomes very illogical and confusing with the text generation tasks. Additionally, with the recent enhancement, ChatGPT-4 has equipped the multimodal technique, which easily generates the output based on image and text prompts.

At this initial stage, ChatGPT has been recognized as having got approx 100 million visits to their applications and website. In contrast, the Google chatbot Bard is still emerging in its beta testing stage.

**Integration of Google Chatbot Bard and OpenAI**  **ChatGPT-4**  **with the corresponding applications:-**

In the current scenario, Microsoft and Google tend to provide a comprehensive solution to their search engine by adding Bard and ChatGPT, respectively.

## OpenAI GPT-4 for Microsoft:-  

Combining OpenAI ChatGPT-4 with Microsoft Edge (Bing) and Teams will result in a new version of this application. All of these implementations contribute to obtaining a customizable and accurate output from massive data sets. But the update is still pending. Also, Microsoft is integrating ChatGPT inside the Opera browser for many users to create more convenient output.

## BARD For Google:-  

Similarly, Google plans to initiate its own AI-based Google Chatbot BARD in its upcoming updates. As we know that Bard is still in its testing phase, it will be used as an AI chatbot in Google search to summarise and manage the search result, providing an exact output. Google also plans to update its AI chatbot in its Lens and Maps, which will be an excellent approach to ease the user interface.

Furthermore, in order to take aggressive action against AI-generated content, Google is constantly updating its algorithm.

**Which technology will propel the AI-Chatbot market?**

## GPT-4 (Pre-Trained Model) or Google Bard (LaMDA):- 

The future is all about AI; we have seen a futuristic update in AI from OpenAI ChatGPT-4 and Google Bard (LaMDA). But this could be surprisingly very challenging to decide which one will succeed in creating a much difference.

Right now, OpenAI ChatGPT is free, but the implementation of GPT-4 will add its plus subscription with the upcoming updates; here, the premium fee of 20$ will be charged for using extra and essential features from ChatGPT.

As compared, Google chatbot Bard will be an extensive competition to **OpenAI chatGPT**. Google bard can provide a more reliable and credible option to many users.

Moreover, Google Bard uses LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications), and OpenAI ChatGPT uses GPT-4. Compared to GPT-4, LaMDA seems more adaptable and accurate while creating or optimizing conversational AI-based Chatbots.

LaMDA has been specifically trained in various dependable scenarios (safety, Quality, and Groundness). All these three aspects make LaMDA more credible sources, generating fewer errors and delving deeper into true human tone responses.

It also provides more authenticated and natural responses to its users, which is easy to understand and relatable to the human speech of context.

Here, it is quite evident that LaMDA proves to be a feasible option when utilizing chatbot technologies.
