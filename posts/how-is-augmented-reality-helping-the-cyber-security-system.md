<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">Augmented Reality Increasing Accountability Through Cyber Security</span>

**Augmented reality (AR)** is a concept that describes how a person's digital experience is enhanced in the actual world. For example, applications such as video games and outdoor navigation systems can be accessed through images of the actual environment when a user wears a head-mounted device with a small screen. **Augmented reality improves visibility by combining digital information with a virtual environment. It's transforming how businesses, organizations, and individuals work, and it could be the next great step in machine evolution.**

When building new AR technology, one of the first things that developers think about is security. Although the term "cyber security" should be known to all, only a few people know about its application to augmented reality.

**Augmented reality** must function in the real world to be regarded as fully effective. However, there are significant drawbacks to incorporating virtual worlds into your everyday life. This blog will delve into **some of the most pressing and pertinent cybersecurity challenges that AR solutions are addressing for potential solutions.**

## Use of augmented reality enhancing cyber-security:-

Augmented reality has the capacity to add to virtual worlds what it lacks in a real-life setting. Additionally, it enables users to explore new areas and have a unique experience. The following benefits of augmented reality are the reasons why it is anticipated that it will influence future technologies:

**Although augmented reality and cyber security are opposed, still the combination of cyber security with an augmented workforce appears to be highly interesting and beneficial. Here are several application scenarios where this exciting innovation can be readily combined:-**


### Safeguard training to an organization:-  

According to a recent survey, one of the main causes of a data breach is a lack of cybersecurity personnel with the necessary training. In the middle of this, organizations require effective training strategies to raise awareness of and educate their staff on cybersecurity, particularly in a world where so much data is moved from client to server. The application of Augmented Reality can provide a solution to this problem through gamified training applications.

These AR-based training applications are highly interactive, providing employees with an immersive learning experience that is likely to result in better performance and productivity when compared to traditional "static" classroom training methods.


### Building a better cybersecurity infrastructure:-    

In the last several years, there have been numerous cybersecurity breaches in the corporate world. One of the most serious issues with cyber attacks is that they are not limited to the internet. The enterprise's security is dependent on several components and systems.

An attempt to interrupt an organization's normal operations is known as a cyberattack. A business must engage in the incident response process once a cyberattack happens to identify the severity of the attack and how to prevent it from happening again. This is usually a reactive procedure rather than a proactive one. However, enterprises can use augmented technology to develop a proactive incident response plan. By seeing how the operation developed and exposed the security system and vulnerabilities of the organization, the security professional will have a better understanding of the endpoints they need to protect in order to thwart further attacks.


### Increasing public awareness:-   

Apart from the organization, everyone must be cautious about cyber security. **While individuals are becoming more aware of online security and using technologies like VPNs, password managers, and antimalware software, many still lack an understanding of cybersecurity.** Every netizen is responsible for ensuring cyber security.

**We can now educate people on significant cyber threats and risks in an interactive fashion. Thanks to recent breakthroughs in Augmented Reality (AR) games and training platforms**. These games and training platforms can be used to teach both technical and non-technical professionals in cybersecurity.

Augmented reality (AR) is a way to view and manipulate digital information in real life. For example, users can see pictures appearing on cards placed on tables. Augmented reality technology has been around for some time, but it is becoming more popular as companies are launching apps that make the most of their capabilities, opening new opportunities for businesses.

Research suggests that users find augmented reality more engaging and interactive than conventional interfaces because they allow them to be creative by mixing physical and digital objects. They also increase the perceived value of items and brands that have been enhanced with this technology and show creativity on behalf of the company that developed them.

## Does AR have a future?   

Augmented reality has revolutionized many sectors and will be around the peak of development for at least the next 10 years. The future could have limitless possibilities because augmented reality looks like it's here to stay! The use of augmented reality (AR) has taken off, integrating virtual objects into the real world. What was once a fantasy from sci-fi films is now a regular experience! In the realm of augmented reality, the future seems to have no limits.

So, if want a future-proof tech career, you can certainly opt for an industry-ready, <a href="https://learnbay.co/artificial-intelligence-certification-course" target="_blank">Advanced AI and ML certification</a>.

### How is AR altering the universe?          

Digital information can be layered and integrated into our actual world using augmented reality (AR), a technology. This will help us to use our homes as learning, working, and entertainment areas during a worldwide pandemic when many of us are now at home using this also as a helping tool by staying indoors more than ever before during such outbreaks to making it safer for others. With this breakthrough, we can undoubtedly avoid a lot of undesirable situations. In addition, security measures have improved significantly as a result, and with such improvements, we can more readily trust AR.

## Final thoughts:- 

Understanding cybersecurity and augmented reality is very beneficial for an organization because we can easily train people and address them to be aware, without having to be physically present at the time, we can manage various organizational tasks through it, and more importantly, with future development, it will undoubtedly ensure the enlightenment of cyber security in the field of technology. I hope this blog has helped you understand the value of augmented reality concerning cyber security.
