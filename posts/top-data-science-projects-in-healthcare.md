A collection of **healthcare data science projects** in the portfolio is vital if you want a lucrative career transition within the healthcare industry. The opportunities for a data scientist in healthcare are endless, but the job market competition is harder. If you are in the healthcare sector and want to stay in a win-win position, you need the fusion of two things in your portfolio.

'**_Strong data science concept + real-world and unique data science projects in healthcare_**.'

The healthcare industry is the biggest resource of unstructured data. But, just like other industries, the **role of data science in healthcare** is fastly earning its significance. In fact, without proper data analysis, healthcare industry operations are almost impossible. And without structuring the data, precise analysis is not at all possible. Consequently, the healthcare sectors of India now need plenty of **healthcare data scientists** for **disease prediction, medical imaging, and analysis of scanned images** and data-driven expertise.

**_Read the related blog:_** <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/the-7-best-data-science-project-ideas-to-get-hired-by-top-mncs" target="_blank">The 7 Best Data Science Project Ideas to Get Hired by Top MNCs</a>

The Curriculum vitae (CV) for a position as a **data scientist in the healthcare sector** could be improved by **data science project topics** and ideas for the prediction of **patient health**, treatment & **medical image analysis**, and so on.

## What are some advanced data science projects in healthcare?  

In the healthcare industry, plenty of <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/data-science-jobs-the-busting-ways-to-secure-attractive-packages-in-health-care" target="_blank">data scientist jobs</a> are available. From the utilization of digital scanning, and advanced analytics to electronic health records, data science has proved its importance everywhere. It's a perfect moment for an emerging data scientist to start looking into them.

Now let's dive into the seven best-advanced **data science-related projects in healthcare** in 2023.

**1. Prediction on readmissions**

**2. Pneumonia Detection using CNN (92.6% Accuracy)**

**3. Diabetes Prediction - Voting classifiers**

**4. Heart Attack Prediction**

**5. Visceral Adipose on Pregnancy**

**6. Body Fat Prediction (99.5%)**

**7. Breast cancer CNN Densenet**

## 1. Prediction on readmissions   

**Tools Utilized**: Python, sklearn, Binary classification

Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaiwen6/prediction-on-readmissions-using-pipeline/input?select=diabetic_data.csv" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kaggle</a>

The dataset includes clinical services offered for over ten years (1999â€“2008) at 130 American hospitals and integrated healthcare networks. There are more than 50 characteristics that indicate patient as well as hospital results. The database was checked for interactions that complied with the following requirements, and information was then extracted from it.

(1) This is a routine hospital visit (consultation).

(2) This is a diabetic incident, meaning diabetes was recorded as a diagnosis during the interaction.

(3) The visit lasted not more than 14 days and no less than one day.

(4) Laboratory tests were conducted during the visit.

(5) Prescription of drugs that were provided during the interaction.

The data includes features like

-  The patient number

-  Gender, race, and age

-  Admission Type

-  Duration of hospital stay

-  Admitting physician's medical specialty

-  The number of lab tests conducted

-  The results of the HbA1c test

-  The diagnosis; the total number of medications he number of diabetic medications

-  The number of inpatients, outpatient, and medical emergency visits during the year before hospitalization.

**There are two key targets**:

-  To develop a trustworthy and effective <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/10-must-know-machine-learning-algorithms-for-beginners-in-2023" target="_blank">machine learning algorithm</a> that could be utilized to forecast whether diabetic patients would require readmission within a month.

-  To identify which factors are most critical in the readmission of diabetes patients.

By considering demographic data, changes in medical specialties, and other factors, this study hopes to advise physicians. The advice is regarding the probability of early readmission for diabetic patients.

Hospitals and the healthcare industry may recognize areas for development. They can also set indicators to prevent readmissions and enhance patient outcomes by forecasting readmission rates.

Moreover, forecasting readmission rates might assist in locating high-risk individuals who can profit from extra assistance and interventions.

This can be one of the impressive **healthcare data science projects** that can improve elderly and chronic disease care.

**Tips to be on the top preference of the interview panel**: The best will be if you collect your local hospitals' or regional hospitals' data and do a completely fresh project on the same.

**Code**:

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/utm-5.png"  class="img" alt="A snippet shows the codes for the predicting test accuracy model on the training data." title="Evaluate the best model on the test data"/> <br/>

**Output conclusion**

Three models are implemented throughout the modeling phase:

1. Logistic Regression
   
2. <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/random-forest-model-rfm" target="_blank">Random Forest</a>, and
   
3. <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/everything-about-the-xgboost-classifier" target="_blank">XGBoost</a>.

Assuming that the predictive accuracy of these models is comparable. Also, we can consider that the logistic regression method is easier to interpret than tree-based models.

Then, it could potentially provide clinicians with additional information about whether a patient will be readmitted before 30 days.

Particularly, elderly individuals (70+) tend to weigh more, which makes sense. A1Cresult and medical specialties like repaglinide appear to be significant factors in readmission, in addition to the number of inpatient and discharge types.

## 2. Pneumonia Detection using CNN (92.6% Accuracy)   

**Tools Utilized:** Python sklearn, CNN

Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/rimshajanjua/pneumonia-detection-using-cnn-92-6-accuracy/input" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kaggle</a>

The dataset is divided into the following three folders: train, test, and val.

Each category (Pneumonia/Normal) has a separate subfolder inside the dataset.

There are two categories (Pneumonia/Normal) and 5,863 X-Ray images in JPG format.

Chest X-ray medical imaging (anterior-posterior) was chosen from retrospective cohorts of child patients. All of them had an age range of one to five. The location chosen organization was the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Hospital in Guangzhou.

All chest X-ray screenings were done as part of the regular clinical treatment provided to patients.

All chest radiographs are originally inspected for quality checks before being eliminated from the chest X-ray (medical) image analysis.

Before the evaluations of the pictures could be utilized to train the AI system, they were evaluated by two qualified physicians.

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/utm-9.png"  class="img" alt="A grided X-ray image of a normal human chest shows two axis. The horizontal axis ranges from 0 to 140, and the vertical axis ranges from 140 to 0. " title="Xray image of normal person"/> <br/>

The dataset has to be artificially enlarged to prevent the overfitting issue. The objective is to replicate the variations by making minor adjustments to the training data. Here you need to apply data augmentation.

**Data augmentation** strategies are methods that modify the training data in a style that modifies the array format while preserving the label.

Grayscales, vertical flips, horizontal flips, random cropping, translations, color jitters, rotations, and other common augmentations are used frequently.

Users might quickly double or triple the range of training instances and build a strong model by applying these modifications to the training data.

To execute data augmentation the following steps should be followed:

- Randomly rotating a few training pictures by 30 degrees.
  
- Randomly Zooming by 20% a few training pictures.
  
- Randomly shifting images by 10% of the width horizontally.
  
- Randomly shifting images by 10% of the height vertically.
  
- Randomly flipping the pictures horizontally. Once the model is ready, the training dataset will be fitted.

**Code** :

**Pro Tips:** To make such a project more relevant to the contemporary scenario, you can collect data that are relevant to any trending descents like Covid-19.

## 3. Diabetes Prediction Using Voting Classifiers   

**Tools Utilized:** Python, KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, sklearn

Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/daniilidisk/diabetes-prediction-voting-classifiers-85-3-acc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kaggle</a>

According to epidemiological data, there seem to be currently more than 463 million diabetics patients globally, and in 2019 poll forecasts that number will increase to 700 million by 2045. Almost 720,000 people have been diagnosed with diabetes in Greece; the majority of them have type II diabetes, according to estimates.

According to the information above, as the world's population and average life expectancy rise, diabetes statistics will continue to rise significantly.

New machine learning and artificial intelligence calculation procedure have also emerged in addition to offering unique ways of illness detection. Such ways include postprandial glucose or hematological analysis of glycated hemoglobin or next-generation alleles at the genomic level.

By considering the patient's **medical history**, these cutting-edge techniques could be utilized to determine a predictive value for the probability of illness initiation.

In this analysis, machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier, are utilized. Such models help to determine if an individual has a higher probability of obtaining diabetes mellitus. Everything is done based on a variety of measures such as body mass index, blood insulin levels, blood pressure, etc.

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/utm-14.png"  class="img" alt="The codes show Logistic regression, Random forest classifier, and KNN classifier." title="Logistic regression"/> <br/>

When the fundamental <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/types-of-machine-learning-models-quickly-explained" target="_blank">machine learning models</a> have been trained, an estimator called a voting classifier combines the results of all the models to produce a prediction.

A final and more accurate conclusion could be produced using cumulative prediction criteria and a voting choice for each estimator result, improving the prediction's accuracy.

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/utm-15.png"  class="img" alt="A code shows a voting classifier model for diabetes prediction." title="Model prediction"/> <br/>

**Output conclusion**

Finally, users observe that the model's accuracy marginally rises with the combination prediction of the voting classifier compared to the methods separately. The F1 score, therefore, equals roughly 86.4%, and the ultimate accuracy is about 85.3%.

This is one of the most trending **data science project topics**.


## 4. Heart attack prediction
