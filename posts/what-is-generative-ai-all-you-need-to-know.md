# Why Has Generative AI For Deepfake And Synthetic Data Been So Popular Till Now?


**AI-generated deep fake** and **synthetic data** appears to be a very fascinating topic these days, with a developing trend. We've seen a lot of examples, and one of the most common examples of Deepfake and Synthetic data is Instagram or TikTok. Yes, these two crazily popular apps are powered by Deepfake.

Deep learning Algorithms are growing more rapidly, and their role will become more pervasive as a result, leading to what some experts refer to as **"Generative AI."** This concept is already in use in optimization techniques, for example. All of this, however, is only the beginning of this technology, which is expected to undergo much more modifications in the future. **So, much more in the future, resulting in products and services that we can only imagine in sci-fi tales.**

**Deepfakes and generative AI** are at the core of a majority of tech controversies right now. On a daily basis, we see new technology for making these types of images and videos.

## Synthetic Data- What Does it mean? 
Let's look at what synthetic data is, the different forms of synthetic data that exist, and how these models are employed in business to see if this is a worry for our privacy.

Synthetic data is a concept that is still relatively new. In recent years, AI applications such as image recognition, text generation, and speech recognition algorithms have grown in popularity, which requires a large amounts of data for training.

## Now - what is Deepfake technology? Many people might be curious about that.   

Deepfake technology allows us to create false content by using our imagination. It can be used to replace or synthesize faces and audio, as well as manipulate emotions in synthetic media. It has the potential to have a significant impact on the entertainment industry because it can be used to detect fake news.

On a daily basis, we are bombarded with misleading news and inaccurate information via social media. However, you might be astonished to learn that the ability to make a fake video (with a genuine person's face) was recently made available. We shall see a lot more of this form of media and its impact on society in the coming years. It is used to digitally recreate an activity that wasn't done by a human.

Deepfakes have made headlines for face-swapping applications. While this is a very important application of the technology, it is only one of the many. As a result, this blog will undoubtedly assist you in becoming identified with some deep fake technologies:- **We also highlight the use cases for each of these applications.**

Four branches from deepfaking lists,  logos related to 'text generation', 'speech cloning,' lip-syncing,' and 'face-swapping.'"/>

## Highlights on DeepFake technology:- 


- ### Text Generation

Text Generation is a method of autonomously generating text, writing stories, prose, and poetry, constructing abstracts of long documents, and synthesizing using AI approaches for text and deep learning. Text generation also refers to the process of using computers to generate human-readable text, usually in natural language, for the purpose of creating content for websites. The generated content can be in the form of whole sentences or phrases, or it can be used to fill in the blanks with individual words, or it can be reviewed by a human before being published.

- ### Speech cloning      


<a href="https://www.learnbay.co/artificial-intelligence-certification-course" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence</a> is still in its nascent stages, but it is making significant strides every passing day. Speech cloning is a <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/nlp-and-deep-learning-for-data-scientists" target="_blank">deep-learning</a> technique that uses an individual's voice recordings to create a synthetic voice that sounds identical to the original. **It's a method of creating a personalized voice font for a person and then using that font to make a speech.**

- ### Lip-syncing

The method of syncronizing a character's lips to a taped voice soundtrack is known as lip-syncing. **Dubbing is the inverse of lip-syncing, in which the character's mouth motions are matched with a prepared voice soundtrack.**

- ### Face-swapping   

Face-swapping has become a popular convention that can be found on practically every social media platform. Users of social media platforms such as Snapchat can send photos to their friends and different individuals that substitute their faces with a different image or even a cartoon. Facebook users can use filters to replace their acquaintances' faces with their own on social media sites. Face swapping has become a popular fad on social networking platforms. Face swapping is becoming more and more lifelike as technology advances.

So these were the few applications where Deepfake and synthetic AI were used, and with such characteristics, there has been a sequential growth in both beneficial and negative use of the application.

**Moving forward, the application's few merits and demerits are:-** 

## Merits of Deepfake and Synthetic data:-

- In today's increasingly digitized and virtual world, it's becoming easier to replicate something that was once a tangible object as an artificial intelligence-driven medium. The main domain where the technology is focused on audio and video. There is an ever-growing list of AI-powered media that can be customized to meet your demands.

- Synthetic Media will democratize content creation by making large-scale music, video, and image production easier and more cost-effective without the use of expensive physical procedures.

- It creates detailed avatars of individuals from which realistic videos can be created.

- It's the ability to create a self-expression avatar experience. It's a fantastic trend that helps people to broaden their goals, ideas, and convictions.

- Actors play a crucial role in any film. Their job is to provide realism to the film. But what if you could make the movie more realistic by reducing the amount of time the actors spend on the set? Artificial intelligence and Deepfake AI accomplish this. Filmmakers would be able to focus more on the film's overall quality if the performers' time was freed up, as they would have more time for editing, etc.

## Demerits-    
- Artificial intelligence (AI) is clearly headed in a direction that will make it a more visible aspect of our media consumption. Companies are progressively incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into their designs in order to make their online content more intelligent and comprehensive, but the primary concern is when the usage of AI makes some types of synthetic media risk for brands to incorporate.

- Deep fakes are a cutting-edge technique for altering photographs and movies in a completely undetectable way to the observer. Deep fakes have the potential to change the way we transmit information since they are a low-cost, high-impact technique to skew the truth.

- Ai-generated media frequently lacks in various fields of arts and crafts, and they don't appear to produce clear and useful output.

## How is synthetic media used in business communication? 
If you've heard about all of the numerous varieties of virtual reality, you might be perplexed by this field of technology. I **t also doesn't help that it's frequently associated with other concepts like augmented reality and mixed reality.**

The way we communicate will alter as a result of synthetic media. It will alter the way we interact as well as the way we think. Artificial intelligence-driven text synthesis is the most obvious example of synthetic media._

## Final thoughts

We hope you enjoyed our Generative AI and synthetic data blog! This is a relatively new technology industry and we certainly look forward to seeing how it develops and benefits businesses and customers in the next few years. With every significant breakthrough, both the benefits and drawbacks of the product increase, but we can also conclude that the application cases of generative AI and synthetic data are numerous, and it has most likely changed the AI and marketing industries immensely.
