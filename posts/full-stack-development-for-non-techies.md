Whenever we hear the term 'developer,' it automatically reflects the identity of a professional with a technical background. But nowadays, the scenario has changed; even a person with a non-tech background can become a professional tech developer. Full stack is a favorably promising profession. As a result, there is a significant increase in competition in the relevant field.

There is a considerable requirement for competent professionals to handle various tasks in the development of an application. 

Finding a proper way to learn full stack development as a non-tech professional may be challenging. But with extra effort, even non-techies can become full stack software developers. There is a significant requirement for competent professionals to handle various development tasks within an organization.

To have a successful full stack career as a non-tech professional, you must know the proper learning methodologies. The journey for non-techies is not so different from that of those with technical proficiency. It requires an extra bit of effort to become comfortable with the technical prerequisites.

Look at these essential steps to evolve as a full stack software developer and unleash your technical skills.</br></br>


## 1. Understand a full stack developer’s duties

Full stack developers can develop the entire application from scratch with their front and back-end development knowledge. They are proficient in front-end, which includes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

They also possess practical knowledge of programming languages such as Node.js, Python, and Java for back-end development. Apart from these two, their experience in database management and web servers also comes in handy.

There are a variety of roles a full stack software developer takes on. Some of these include:

-  Creating an application from the ground up

-  Collaborating with interface design teams for app development, testing, and implementation

-  Building user experiences with a robust front-end architecture

-  Database and cloud server management responsibilities

-  Engaging with customers to assess product effectiveness
  </br></br>


## 2. Learn front-end designing   

Learning the design and layout of the software is the initial step. Front-end developers make up the user interface of a program. This covers layout planning, document creation, and adding interactive elements. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are a few fundamental skills to master.

<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</p>: HTML is a widely used markup language to create applications.

<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</p>: It is used to design the sheet language, which defines the overall look and feel of an application or web page.

<p>JavaScript(JS)</p>: It is a programming language for creating interactive and dynamic applications.

In addition, they need experience with at least one framework, such as Angular or React, required in the front end. </br></br>

## 3. Learn back-end programming     

Back-end development comes after learning the front-end. The back end is the process of creating a program’s server-side components. Database management, user authorization, and server-side logic execution are all part of back-end processes.

Back-end technologies include programming languages and frameworks, which you must learn. Some important ones are as follows:

-  <p>Languages</p> such as Node.js, Python, and Java.

-  <p>Frameworks</p> such as Express.js, Django, and Spring.

If the back-end (server side) processes are not working properly, the user experience will deteriorate. These main back-end programming languages and frameworks help ensure the software functions efficiently. </br></br>

## 4. Gaining knowledge of databases  

The database helps store, manage, and access information for software development. PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB are widely used database applications. You can link to database management systems using the Python or Java programming languages.

A full stack software developer knows how to develop and manage a database. Based on the project specifications, you need to choose the kind of database to use. Understanding the proper utilization of databases is essential for a software development project. </br></br>

## 5. Gain practical experience  

Software development requires you to have a practical understanding of frameworks and languages so you can create effective code. Projects also help you determine areas to improve and act accordingly. Here, practicing plays a prominent role in building a continuous and basic understanding of technical terminologies.

You may begin with small projects and keep expanding your reach. Keep learning until you start working on large-scale projects developed in industries. Websites such as Stack Overflow and GitHub help students practice and study with other students on the platform.

In addition, you may also find internship opportunities or entry-level positions. These can help you extensively use your knowledge and enhance your skills. You will receive hands-on training in the field and collaborate with professional developers who will assist you in learning more about your industry. </br></br>

## 6. Create a portfolio   

Your portfolio is the first impression of your technical skills as a full stack developer. It is a chance to impress the recruiter with your expertise and knowledge. A portfolio perfectly highlights your experience on the project, so make sure you describe each in detail.

Include the information below in your full stack portfolio:

-  Describe the project

-  Mention the technologies utilized

-  Describe your contribution to project creation

-  Demonstrate the proof with screenshots 
  </br></br>

### -  Coding   

You will likely face a technical round where you are supposed to put your coding skills to the test. The recruiters will evaluate your skills and ability to deliver under pressure. Different types of assessments, such as live coding, home assignments, and program analysis, can be given.
Practice on online platforms such as HackerRank and LeetCode daily. Prepare for every scenario by solving coding tasks in 30 to 40 minutes. </br></br>

### -  Interview Questions

You can expect technical, coding-based questions that the interviewers will use to understand your knowledge level. These can be tricky, so prepare beforehand with some common full stack interview questions.

Apart from coding, you can also get behavioral or soft skills-based questions. These questions help the interviewer assess your social skills and also understand if you could fit into the company culture.
