We all know industries are implementing <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course-training-in-bangalore" target="_blank">data science and AI</a> innovation to earn maximum profitable outcomes. Even non-technical business operation segments rely more on certified data analysts than experienced non-analytical specialists. Marketing, sales, human resource, etc., fall into such segmentations. As a result, at least basic **data analytics** skills are going to be the must-have criteria for all domains.

But, <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/different-jobs-opportunities-of-data-science" target="_blank">data science jobs</a> are in much demand. At the same time Simultaneously, countless certified data scientists are falling out of their jobs. Then why do incidents of unemployment still exist in the life of data scientists?

Let's dig out the scopes associated with an industry-ready, unique **IBM data science professional certificate**.

## What is an interview-guaranteed IBM data science Professional Certificate?

While scrolling on the internet, you find plenty of IBM certifications for machine learning, AI, and data science. But a few only will provide an interview guarantee.

## Key reasons for Certified Data scientist Profile Rejections by Recruiters:

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/foh-3.png" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An illustration illustrating the crucial aspect that the majority of data scientistÂ profiles are turned down by recruiters."/>

Most of the candidates get repeatedly rejected. In other words, applicants are unable to attract the attention of recruiters. This is because of incompatible resume content. The IBM professional data science courses under consideration will help you to optimize your resume and portfolio. Certainly, chances will be greater than top MNCs highlighting your resumes on their priority list.

## How to choose the right certification course in Data Science?    

Whenever you are joining any AI, and Data Science course, first make sure

- They are authorized and offer globally recognized certificates
- The certification course contains fresh and live projects aided by current industry standards and trends. The right project exposure in your resume and portfolio is essential.
- The certification should adhere to your targeted data science career and focused industries. I meant to say that if you are already in the mid-level career stage, the course must make you eligible to grab a mid-to-senior level data science job only.
- And yes, most importantly, instead of discarding your existing industrial knowledge, the course must utilize the same to make you a proficient data scientist.

Until now, I have discussed the professional IBM certification. But have you ever heard of the specialization certification in data science? _If you want to ensure a high-paid and continuously growing data science and AI career, then you need to choose a specialization certification course instead of professional certification._

## What is the difference between specialization and professional IBM certification?  

At the very beginning, I mentioned 'A unique IBM Certification'- and here comes the real uniqueness. The data science courses under consideration are not only 'professional certifications .'It's a 'Specialization certifications' too.

Let me simplify it a bit.

Specialization certificates are what make you stand out from the other candidates who apply for the **data science** and AI job roles. Such certificates are those where students get specific certificates against each type of specific skill earned.

It's not that difficult to earn a professional certificate in data science. You can even earn multiple ones. Plenty of self-paced courses are available. But for a specialization certificate, you have to be fully dedicated to your learning. Consequently, the weight of such certifications is way greater and thus ensures a successful and ever-growing data science career. For those who are transitioning to data science, this is especially true.

At present, you can get three types of specialized **IBM certifications** in a single course.

1. Domain-specialized course completion certification
2. Project Experience Certification

Domain-specific training and Project Experience certification are something that takes the **IBM data science certification course** under consideration into the limelight.

With 8+ elective domain options (both tech and non-tech), you get specialized recognition of microdata science skills too. So, within a single course, you get 6 to 8 specialized IBM certifications.

But the ultimate magic key is the project experience certification by IBM. As your practical abilities get authenticated by IBM hence, your resume easily gets to the notice of top companies.

It's not the end. The specialization feature even goes beyond the certificates. Based on your present career stage and educational background, you get custom-fit courses as well as learning modules. Even an aspirant with 7+ years of a professional career can easily switch to the data science field with the help of such certification programs as you have the option of specialized <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-ai-for-managers" target="_blank">data science and AI certification courses for Managers and Leaders</a>.

## Then what do the professional certifications in data science offer?  

Professional certificates are those certificates where students just get a normal certificate. It's mainly a certificate stating that they have completed the particular course.

But such certificates do not hold much value as compared to the specialized **IBM data science certification.**

## Is this IBM certification Recognised?   

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/foh-4.jpeg" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="A data scientist in a black suit is walking towards a highly developed city entrance. He holds a briefcase."/>

IBM is a global giant and a leader in its industry and is it worth it in reality? **IBM data science professional certification** includes overall theoretical work combined with applied learning techniques. This increases efficiency in crucial areas of **data science roles** in the present market. Almost 46 percent of candidates who took specialized courses with any background knowledge in any tech or non-tech industry or the data science field will be better off. And as already told, your industrial ability gets recognized. What can be more reliable than this to the recruiters?

The main requirement is a passion for **data science learning** and growth within the field. This makes it simple and easy for anyone interested in starting a career in data science **.** Data science is a broad technology, and employers need those professionals who are experts with data science tools and technologies. The IBM data science specialized certificates give employers additional courage to choose their respective employees.

## So - where can you get such a unique and specialized IBM professional certification?
