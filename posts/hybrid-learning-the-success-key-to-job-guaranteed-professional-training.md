# Hybrid Learning- The Success Key To Job-Guaranteed Professional Training

How Can Hybrid Learning Help You Achieve the Full-fledged Benefits of an Online Professional Course?



Upgrading technical skills is the only key to sustainable professional growth. It has already been proven that self-learning is not a good choice in the fast-growing job market.

So, all the hype is going on online instructor-led training. But again, with the fast-changing skill excellence drive of the job market, this learning strategy will also be incompetent within the next 2 to 3 years. And here comes the need for a Hybrid **Learning**  Model.

In today's digital age, **hybrid learning** is so widespread that it's become synonymous with the word "learning." Hybrid learning is the concept where training can take place in both digital and physical forum.

Online learning can benefit from many of the same teaching strategies used in traditional classrooms. As an approach, a round robin, in which students write down their ideas on a piece of paper and then hand it off, can be done in the online classroom. Online forums and in-person gatherings are both viable options for having discussions.

With many edtech offering students online courses, they know that at least a gathering once a week is needed. This is essential for better industrial skill authentication. It not only lets students socialize and communicate but even learn together. However, it demands offline project training when it comes to advanced tech skills like <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/artificial-intelligence-certification-course" target="_blank">Artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/why-you-need-data-science/" target="_blank">data science</a>, <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/model-vs-algorithm-in-ml" target="_blank">Machine Learning</a>

## What Is Hybrid Learning?

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/hybrid-2.jpeg" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An image displaying in two halves in which the left one shows a girl undergoing an online class, while the right one shows a batch of students undergoing offline training."/>

**Hybrid learning** (aka blended learning) is the combination of learning online and on-site. A **hybrid class**  design course is how subjects are taught online, and the other activities, like capstone projects and interview preparation, are taught in a classroom dedicated to such activities.

When they meet their tutor or instructor, students can clear their widespread practical doubts(those are hard to solve in virtual meets) at once and also get a touch of expertise while working on a capstone project with the other batch mates.

## What are the benefits of hybrid Learning?      

While hopping around the benefits of hybrid classes, the first question is: 'How has hybrid learning become better compared to instructor-led online learning?'

The following points will let you know why hybrid learning is actually the go-to learning method today.

### 1. Flexibility

Hybrid learning allows students to learn a subject in their interest and speed. Unlike in a conventional classroom, students have to learn from the whole lecture in one go (from the perspective of the course duration). This can make students go off-topic or even be bored with learning. But in Hybrid classes, the students can attend the classes in a digital method but with live training, which they can pause and resume (by altering batches) when they need.

Now the question becomes, you can get better flexibility, completely online classes, and even recorded video-based training. Then why's it special in hybrid one?

Getting something beyond expectation might also be harmful. The same applied to 100% online training. In such courses, about 60% of candidates complete the course at a 4 times slower speed. In some cases, it takes years after years, and when they complete it, the particular skill has already lost its importance in the job market.

### 2. Affordability   

The internet has made learning very feasible and accessible. As it does not require any traveling, that cuts down the experience the same for about 60% of sessions. In fact, if you compare the course fees with offline university courses, it seems cheaper with a similar kind of practical experience. Hybrid online courses not only provide a lot of knowledge of the natural world but even offer **certificates of completion** and projects so you can stand above all.


### 3. Accessibility   

The accessibility of the platform is optimized and can be accessed through mobile phones and other devices. Students can access study materials and class recordings whenever they want. Around 4.88 billion people across the globe have access to the internet. This makes the academic content available from any location for students and removes the geographical barrier to learning.

The above benefits the online sessions associated with hybrid learning, similar to all other online learning modes.

But the critical benefits regarding accessibility lie in the offline sessions. The platform provides multi-city/multi-state training centers to ensure the maximum possible reach. This adds up reliability scores in the platforms' course accessibility.

### 4. Infrastructural expenses   

This point is solely mentioned for edtech business aspects.

The conventional method needs civil infrastructure and expenses. The digital classroom saves this cost and time. As project sessions are conducted offline, a well-equipped lab is enough for the same, which can be rented at an affordable price. Even the cost of power to maintain the classroom and its resources can be saved to a certain extent.

### 5. Proper Handling of Differentiation      

Differentiation is a critical word in education, not for the elementary level. The differentiation in education means that people learn at different paces. Like some students need more extensive text in slides or need a translation. They might even have to replay a few classes in which in-class training and the lecturer wouldn't return to the same topic.

Hybrid classes make teaching more responsible by checking on the number of candidates present, which reduces the wastage of time for attendance. The system submits the project, so you do not have to go around many classes for projects. It even makes learning a tool rather than students taking it as a burden.

### 6. Time-bound

Everyone learns at a different pace, which is a fact to be acknowledged. So in the traditional way of learning, there is no room for self-paced learning. Students must attend the lecture as they are conducted and submit the project as everyone else. This would make students more exhaustive.

In blended learning, self-paced is what can be focused on, which removes the barrier between fast and slow learners. Here students can learn in their own time, submit assignments and capstone projects whenever they have finished, and even contact the lecturer. Even after that, everything gets completed within a specified timeline, just like university courses.

### 7. Time management  


Time management and its practices are crucial for students in any field of education. According to a survey, 87% of learners say that time management helped them improve their grades. Without this, learners and lecturers can lag in their work. So hybrid learning can let lecturers be ready with their work and lets students learn in a more efficient method.

In fact, for working professionals, time management becomes the most prominent success factor in the hybrid learning mode.  **This is a prime reason for considering**  **hybrid learning**  **a magic key to successful career transformation** .

### 8. Focused Learning

Many of the traditional classes have one issue: either learner are in or are out of it. If they ever miss a class because of illness or any other issue, then they may never get to learn from the same class again. In hybrid learning, the videos are live and not pre-recorded, so every class recording you view later is new. So it is not like the videos are pre-recorded and are sent all at once. Students will gain nothing from it.

But students do not have to worry when they miss class or topics; they can attend an alternative live class. And some students like to learn in the environment they want, like learning alone in a room without any disturbance from anyone, so they can concentrate much more on the lecturer and the class.

### 9. Benefits in practical skill development

Theory can be studied by self and can be better understood when someone explains it. But when it comes to practical skills like programming language and coding and when you put it on paper, It is difficult to do the same. Hybrid classes for capstone projects can make learners improve their practical skills along with other batch mates. It will be great as they would come to the hybrid class center where they can learn with their classmates and work on projects collaboratively. So learners can enjoy both the online comfort and, at the same time, enjoy learning practically by working on capstone projects in hybrid classes.

## Hybrid classes for the Indian Education system (For Professional Training)  

India is one of the largest countries by population, and educating such a number with the best quality is not a challenge but one of the most difficult tasks. The materials, infrastructure, and traveling facilities all come with a cost.

The challenges India faces to educate everyone irrespective of their background or race, or religion Hybrid classes are the only way we can achieve a 100% literacy rate at a rapid pace.

Hybrid learning can help face challenges like high cost, geographical distance, overcrowded classrooms, infrastructure, and education quality.

Even the experts who teach in hybrid classes can alter the topic and subject according to the market needs so you are updated and not outdated. So professionals who want to change their careers will learn the technology and even work on the latest technology through a capstone project in hybrid classes.

### In a Nutshell

AI, Machine Learning, and <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/advance-data-science-certification-courses" target="_blank">data science courses</a> are available for fast and convenient learning. But the drawback is that they offer only online training, and even the projects are not certified. Enroll in courses where your skills and course are recognized with global certificates and even provide expertise in hybrid classes for capstone projects.
