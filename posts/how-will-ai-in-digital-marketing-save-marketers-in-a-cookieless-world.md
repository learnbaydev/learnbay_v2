## How Are Cookies Used to Collect Data?   

Cookies collect user data like viewed pages, page clicks, and PII's **(Personally Identifiable Information)** like device ID, address, name, passwords, and credit/debit card numbers. The data collected by cookies help advertisers and marketers improve the marketing decision process & user experience.

**The primary intention of Cookies was to provide a targeted and personalized experience to the users on the internet. Ad agencies then used it to target users.** The advertisements follow the user on the different websites they visit.

This became an issue with the users as they expected the advertisers to value their privacy. Consumers nowadays are more likely to accept consent-based advertising. On the other hand, they also demand a more individualized browsing experience.

**First-party cookies**

First-party cookies provide the information to a brand that the user has willingly given. The users enter the data during profile creation and online purchasing. This makes first-party cookies an amazing data source available to businesses.

First-party data will have more importance and relevance, so the advertisers can always trust the first-party cookies.

## What is Contextual Advertising?   

Contextual advertising helps marketers place adverts on web pages according to the content on the pages. Unlike other targeting methods, contextual targeting analyzes the website and generates relevant advertisements suited to customers' needs.

Contextual advertising aims to produce brand-suitable ads and target users when consuming similar content.

For, e.g. displaying a mobile phone ad on a blog post about affordable phones online. It is achieved through segmenting ads on the basis of keywords or webpage topics.

This targeting exercises context-centric rather than user-centric approaches. When employed, they don't require the use of cookies and personal data. As a result, the user will see adverts tailored to the webpage content.

Contextual advertising matches the ads to the content rather than the user.

**There are many ways to achieve contextual targeting.**

- Analyzing content on the website and determining the tone.

- Analyzing video/image content to determine the sentiment.

- Analyzing content created by the consumer using natural language processing.

- Automatically develop various inventive elements according to the context.

## d. Data-clean rooms    

Data-clean rooms refer to a shared environment by two applications. They can share and match their data sets based on shared variables. Take the example of Meta or Google, which examines customer information through first-party cookies under tough privacy and protection protocols. The matching data sets may be used to create marketing strategies, improve cross-channel user satisfaction, and improve attribution modeling.

Data-clean rooms are essential for log-level analysis and help marketers deliver insight at an individual level.

An example of a data-clean room is the <a href="https://developers.google.com/ads-data-hub#:~:text=Ads%20Data%20Hub%20enables%20customized,event%2Dlevel%20ad%20campaign%20data." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ads datahub launched by Google</a>.
