<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">The Future of Fashion: How AI Will Change the Way We Design or Choose Dresses </span>

As we have seen, AI is widely used in technology all over the globe. Still, the most recent trend has extended its reach into the fashion industry, greatly assisting them over time and enhancing their ability to conduct profitable business.

Additionally, the fashion sector appears to be one of the most lucrative businesses in the universe, and the advancement of _**AI in the fashion industry**_ has tremendously enhanced through time. This has increased the potential to operate a revenue-based business.

## What impact has AI had on the fashion industry?

AI is gradually but inevitably altering the fashion business as we know it. According to a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1070736/global-artificial-intelligence-fashion-market-size/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Statistica report</a>, the global market for **AI in the fashion industry** was valued at $270 million in 2018 and is expected to reach $4.4 billion by 2027. This technology is addressing numerous problems that the fashion business encounters on a daily basis. The design process can be streamlined, customer service can be strengthened, and production costs can be decreased, among other things.

AI significantly impacts every aspect of the fashion industry, including design, manufacturing, shipping, and marketing. The cool integration of **AI and fashion** technologies are giving fashion and lifestyle manufacturers automated solutions. This enables them to harness the power of **AI in Fashion** and realize its full potential.

To educate business executives in the fashion sector about potential applications for AI, this article evaluates the top AI applications in the field of fashion.

## Let's explore the few use cases and applications listed:-

### 1. AI in fashion designing:-

Design and pattern are crucial when it comes to creating a costume that will appeal to consumers. AI can reduce forecasting errors and assist in predicting new trends.

Fashion trends shift frequently, and new patterns and designs are constantly being created. Designers must be able to follow the most recent fashion trends. While applying **AI in fashion** technology, AI systems can mimic popular trends and analyze designs using picture analysis.

Although many studies have been used in the field of AI-enabled fashion design, there have only been a few practical applications. The foundation of all current applications is the human-in-the-loop (HITL) paradigm.

For instance, Google and the German fashion website Zalando created the _**Muze project.**_ Muze develops clothing designs using machine learning. To generate garment designs, the model collects information from customers about their favorite textures, colors, and fashion preferences by posing a series of questions.


### 2. AI Fashion Stylist Accessorizing Clothing:-  

In the fashion sector, AI stylists are becoming more popular since they help us choose the ideal clothes for our body types and personal style preferences.

AI-enabled clothing and ensembles can be customized to a user's style, body type, preferred colors, and the newest fashion trends, in addition to being adapted for various situations and weather conditions. This technology is changing how we shop for clothes and giving us a more personalized shopping experience.

_Using cutting-edge_ _**computer vision-based**_ _and 3D reconstruction technology,_ _**iLUK**_ _is the first AI-based personal stylist in the world. iLUK is a little pod positioned at retail locations so that you may receive personal styling guidance without ever entering a changing area._

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/aoai-3.jpg" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An illustration shows a woman using a smart mirror for changing and trying clothing apparel."/>


### 3. AI in Smart Mirrors:-            

AI is changing the way we shop for clothes. With smart mirrors, customers can see how clothes look without even putting them on. These mirrors are installed in changing rooms and are equipped with touchscreen glasses that relay information about the customer and the clothing item they've brought into the store. This makes clothing purchasing more enjoyable and convenient.

A sizable interactive mirror made of RFID-enabled clothing racks with gyro-sensors and Bluetooth low-energy chips can be found at the Rebecca Minkoff flagship shop in New York City. This makes it possible for the items chosen by customers to appear in the Smart Mirror automatically.

The customer can add things to their fitting room to try on, receive personalized mix-and-match possibilities, and browse different outfits using the mirror.

### 4. AI In Fashion eCommerce:-     

In the world of eCommerce and online fashion purchasing, AI is changing the game. E-Commerce sites employ AI to accomplish the same thing that retail fashion stores do when recommending similar products to clients based on their taste, budget, and other factors. This delivers a more personalized shopping experience for clients by making it simpler for them to find what they want.

Here, artificial intelligence algorithms examine your filtering habits and the types of things you typically search for. We can make recommendations for additional products based on the study of your search history.

### 5. AI for Visual Search Using Cameras to Find Products:-  

E-commerce stores are increasingly applying AI and computer vision technologies to offer products to customers that are similar to what they are looking for. The name of this technology is **_visual search_.** You can take a picture of something using your camera and use that picture to look up a similar or identical item online.

## How does AI work in marketing campaigns?   

### 1. Virtualized advertising campaigns and fashion shows:-  

According to 83% of <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/retail/our%20insights/fashions%20new%20must%20have%20sustainable%20sourcing%20at%20scale/fashions-new-must-have-sustainable-sourcing-at-scale-vf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mckinsey's 2019 Apparel CPO Survey</a> respondents, physical samples will be utilized less frequently than virtual samples by 2025. COVID-19 is causing the change to occur more quickly than expected. Numerous fashion presentations have creatively transitioned to the virtual world for major luxury brands.

To avoid using the materials and resources necessary to conduct an actual runway, Moschino designed a 'doll fashion show,' in which adorable doll-size outfits were displayed on a runway by marionette dolls.

AI-created 3D digital fashion models are not only lovely to look at, but they also benefit the environment. The Fabricant, which bills itself as the "world's first digital fashion house," claims that switching from physical samples of clothing to digital ones during the design and development stages can lower a brand's carbon footprint by up to 30%.

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/aoai-4.jpg" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An illustration depicts a virtual fashion show, with three women walking down the ramp."/>

### 2. Better customization and virtual fitting rooms lowering refunds and improving customer satisfaction:-    

The value chain's delivery component is a more covert source of pollution. For instance, shipping is quite affordable and effective in China. Because of this, consumers are more likely to return products and avoid making a purchase altogether if they have doubts about how well they'll fit. This leads to needless pollution.

Virtual changing rooms will soon become a reality as 3D virtual model technologies become more accessible. With AI, we can precisely measure our size and modify the digital models as necessary. The amount of pollution brought on by returns will decrease as a result.

Customers can use the smartphone camera on _**MySize's**_ ground-breaking technology to determine the correct garment size. This is beneficial when doing internet purchasing.

Additionally, personalized styling powered by AI and recommender systems is improving the online buying experience more than ever. Stitch fix uses customers' initial Style Quiz results to develop their Style Profile. They also collect information from clients' personal characteristics, garment features, post-Fix feedback, prior interactions with the service, and goods data to create prediction algorithms. Together, these factors contribute to a positive online purchasing experience for customers.

### 3. Increasing the demand for used goods:-  

Among Gen-Xers drawn to the circular economy notion of prolonging a product's life cycle, the second-hand clothes sector is experiencing a renaissance.

The second-hand market is anticipated to experience substantial growth over the next several years. In large part due to the capabilities of AI, in 2018, it was valued at $24 billion, and by 2023, it is anticipated to be worth $51 billion. Users of websites that sell used clothing stand to gain a lot from AI, including better customer experiences thanks to more accurate pricing, better-personalized user experiences, and better styling services.

### 4. AI sales forecasting prevents warehousing:- 

Reducing stockpiling is one of the industry's most well-known and widely adopted practices. As clothing trends evolve daily, stockpiling generates a significant amount of trash. The use of sophisticated data analytics and <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/no-code-machine-learning-just-gone-viral-but-what's-that" target="_blank">machine learning</a> sales forecasting to more accurately estimate sales, fashion trends, and consumer behavior and lower the number of unsold goods each season is one of the most obvious use cases for artificial intelligence in this area.

_**AI has mysteriously integrated technologies with fashion in such a seamless way that it has certainly boosted overall world production.**_

## Conclusion:-  

The benefits of AI in the fashion industry have certainly given the sector access to a whole new range of opportunities. The introduction of AI into the clothing manufacturing process has already made a huge difference, making the sector more productive and efficient.
