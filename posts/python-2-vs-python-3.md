<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">Is it still relevant to learn Python 2 when there is Python 3?</span>

Python is a computer programming language with advanced technology that has reached almost the peak of its advancement. And due to its continuous upgradation and improvement, we have seen many versions of it. In particular, the debate of **Python 2 vs Python 3** has raised significant buzz in the tech community. Especially, for non-tech pros, while getting into it for the first time associated with data science and AI learning.

This high-level programming language is used in various industries, including data science, software engineering, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence.

The creation of these two main versions of the <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/introduction-to-python-programming" target="_blank">Python programming language</a> has made programming more accessible.

Both Python versions operate differently, with significant implications for user requirements. These two Python versions have generated a perplexing concept in the user's mind.

There has been a lot of discussion throughout history over which of the two formats is better and simpler to learn.

Acquiring Python knowledge is a better option for those just starting to explore a programming language. It becomes very easy to interpret and has excellent demand in businesses and industries.

The Python 3 programming language, which is presently in operation, was developed to address and resolve various imperfections and defects of Python 2. But still, several software experts utilize Python 2, even though it is practically outdated.

Let's now interpret and check the difference through the most demanding discussion of Python 2 vs Python 3 in detail. Also, I'll explain why Python 2 continues to be utilized even though Python 3 has already been developed and upgraded.

## Python 2:- What does it mean?

Python 2.0 came into the limelight in the year 2000. Programmers were capable of simplifying the code generation process compared to past editions due to the release of Python 2. Python 2.7, which was terminated in 2020, marked the termination of the Python 2. x series.

## Python 3:- What does it mean?

Python 3, was introduced in late 2008, and it was just a troubleshooting version of Python 2. It has the latest version of the programming language, which was intended to address the issues programmers had with Python 2.

The primary intention for Python development was to eliminate repetition, or the tendency to use similar code repeatedly, from the coding process.

Programmers can be easily compatible with Python 3, which tries to solve the issues that beginners encounter while learning a new programming language.

## Sample Code for Python 2 and Python 3

### Print function-

As print in Python 2 is a statement, it will be expressed as **print \<output content\>.** whereas print in Python 3 acts like a function; therefore, in this case, it is expressed as a **print(\<output content\>)** with the result enclosed in parentheses.

### Integer Division-

Whenever analyzing integer numbers in Python 2, the result does not include decimal values. Instead, it responds to round numbers that intensify the issue. when compared, the result of Python 3 includes decimal values, as a result, is regarded as the precise output.

**Analyzing for Python 3:-**

**_Note:_** When converting code from Python 2. x to Python 3. x or vice versa, one should be careful while evaluating the integer value since, even though no mistakes are seen during compilation, unexpected outcomes may still occur.

### Unicode Strings-

Python 2 assumes storing strings as ASCII, and if Unicode storage is needed, the string must be specifically specified with the letter "u", but Python 3 saves strings as UNICODE by default.

Unicode strings are much more flexible than ASCII strings in that they can hold letters from other languages, emojis, common Roman characters, and digits, making the transformation of strings into Unicodes desirable.

**Python 2. x UNICODE string:-**

**Python 3. x UNICODE string:-**

### Error Handling-

The only slight difference in error handling between Python 2 and Python 3. In Python 3, a new keyword called "as" is introduced, which is mandated; if it is not specified, an error will be produced. This was not the situation in Python 2.

**Python 2. x Error Handling:-**

**Python 3. x Error Handling:-**

### Xrange-

The behavior and attributes of xrange() used in Python 2 are integrated into the "range()" function in Python 3. The range() function is quicker than the xrange() in terms of speed.

**Xrange for Python 2**

**Xrange for Python 3:-**

### Raising Exception-

**In Python 3. x, the syntax for raising an exception has changed with parenthesis.**

**Python 2. x will almost execute the below syntax. But, this is without parenthesis.**

## Which one would be the better version? Python 2 or Python 3.

Below are the following details that might offer that Python 3 is currently the most demanding and preferred language above Python 2.

- The main reason for opting for Python 3 is that Python 2 is out of date since 2020. In contrast, Python 3 is currently popular among developers providing ease and stability to new programmers who were unsure of programming. They can pursue programming as a path forward.

- Compared to its predecessors, particularly Python 2, Python 3 is a very popular, legible, and simple language.

- There is no more Python 2 in the current channel. It is only employed if any legacy Python 2 code exists or when a business requires to convert Python 2 code to Python 3.

- Realistic data at the moment show that Python 2 has lost programmers' attention, and they are now primarily interested in Python 3. This indicates that Python 3 has overcome Python 2 in the competition.

Depending on these factual differences, we can easily understand the better version of Python. Additionally, selecting the optimal Python version becomes a critical resource for data scientists. Data science has seen a sudden hype in today's tech market, and Python provides various libraries that help to deal with mathematical problems and data analysis.

## Python 2 to Python 3 converter:-

Using the 2 to 3 module, we can convert codes from Python 2 to Python 3. The syntax is modified from Python 2 to Python 3. We can switch all the Python 2 files inside a specific folder to Python 3.

Python does not include this module by default. On the terminal, install this by using the below command.

**Syntax**

## Which Python version is better for data science?

We have seen the significant distinctions between both versions of programming languages, which makes us confident that over this period of instruction, you may have understood the uses and implications of it. In this post, we have covered every significant portion of both languages and their latest versions to make it easier for you to understand how they differ.

In a nutshell, it will help you to decide whether to implement Python 2 or Python 3. Python 3 may be a superior alternative depending on market demand and uses; however, this depends entirely on the user's perspective and decision.

It's always recommended to use the latest version, which is Python 3.x. Python 3 offers better usability and more advanced features. However, to understand the core functionality you must go through version 2 also. So, you should start learning with the 3, and later have a look at the 2.

## How to become a Python pro for data science?

To study more about the Python programming language in-depth, enroll in the **Microsoft and IBM certified** <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/advance-data-science-certification-courses" target="_blank">Advanced Data Science and AI Program with Domain Specialization</a>. This will prepare you to cope with numerous functions of data science, AI, and even in the knowledge of various industry-based python specific projects.
