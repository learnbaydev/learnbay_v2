# Women in AI - Top 10 Indian Women Empowering the World of AI

<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">Know The Women AI Leaders From India, Excelling In The Tech World.</span>



A decade ago, very few Indian women used to choose the tech field as their career. Even after owning 100 times better technical intelligence, so many Indian women lost themselves in the crowd. Their intelligence remained limited and unrevealed under the stacks of certificates. Here, always the barrier has been the fear of not getting adopted by the fast-track corporate culture.

But times have changed. The world can witness and learn from the Indian women leaders in AI today, who provide the best technical power to global technology. Women in India are only known for their orthodox lives in-home or how well they do the daily chores at home, and they have broken into the world of technology and even led it with ideas and tech solutions.

Women leading data and AI in India today are empowering the top giant firms like Wipro, Infosys, Accenture, and many more. When I'm talking about top giants, it does not mean they are only IT. But they are in R&D, Data Analytics,Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Blockchain, Robotics, and many more. So Indian **women in AI** are becoming a legend for the entire world.

**AI - powered Technology** is not a man-oriented designation anymore. **Women are leading AI,** **Machine learning,** and computer vision, and this shift in society cannot be unseen.

## **From where it started? The Idea of Women Leaders In AI**  

Accenture has always worked on gender equality and aims to achieve <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/accenture-sets-goal-to-achieve-gender-balanced-workforce-by-2025.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a gender balance workforce by 2025.</a> The Accenture Vaahini has given many opportunities to upskill and re-skill at Accenture's **AI.**

The panelists said that the edtech online platforms offer virtual courses and certification, changing the world and women to be a leader in <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/advance-data-science-certification-courses" target="_blank">data science and AI</a>.

The technology sector has a lot of gender gaps. Science, Technology, and Engineering have gender issues with primary men, which is critical to address. The only way to remove this gender barrier in AI is to encourage women to apply for a career in the technology sector. As per the World economic forum, women account for around 22% of AI experts worldwide. These women's AI role <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/model-vs-algorithm-in-ml" target="_blank">models</a> are breaking the gender stereotype in technology. So young girls and other women are getting the courage to pursue a STEM career. So, we can say that the thought or the journey of 'women in AI' achieved its initiation from Accenture, in India.

Here are the top Indian **women in AI** or better to say top Indian women leaders in AI to address.

Google's diversity report says only 10% of women work with **machine intelligence.** Thus, encouraging women to learn new age technology like AI and ML or any other technology so women can lead the future of AI.
