<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px"> Artificial Intelligence vs. Augmented Intelligence: The Goals are Same But Not the Approaches </span>

The term "technology" has significantly impacted the world today. We have seen a rapid increase in the use of technology in all aspects of human life over the last few years. Furthermore, automation has always fascinated and intrigued humanity with solutions such as artificial intelligence and **intelligence augmentation**, essentially automating the business and other activities of human life techniques.

Technology such as artificial intelligence and **intelligence augmentation** aid in:-

-  streamlining workflow

-  Improving productivity

-  Lowering costs in order to reduce the human workload

However, all of this technology serves different purposes and is based on different business requirements. And the dilemma of artificial intelligence vs. augmented intelligence is still there as a hot topic.

## What is artificial intelligence?

Artificial intelligence has the potential to develop intelligent machines. Such machines function and react much like humans. Accordingly, we can quickly make decisions and handle challenging or complex situations.

Therefore, we can conclude that AI has tremendous potential to change both the tech and non-tech sectors.

## What is augmented intelligence?   

The word "**intelligence augmentation (IA)**" or "**augmented intelligence**" (also referred to as "cognitive augmentation") is a substitute for AI that helps by emphasizing human performance to make it faster and wiser.

Fundamentally, IA is intended to enhance rather than diminish human intelligence. All of this makes IA more desirable from a marketing perspective.

**Note**: **Sometimes, IA is also referred to as augmented AI.**

## What is the key difference between intelligence augmentation and artificial intelligence?  

Here comes the answer for "**artificial intelligence vs. augmented intelligence**."

The primary difference between **artificial intelligence and intelligence augmentation** is determined by how we apply technology.

Yes, it is actually how both technologies approach (which differs) their preset goals (which can be the same for both).

AI is primarily designed to carry out numerous tasks simultaneously for humans. The intelligence augmentation does not need to participate in any decision-making process. Instead, it can analyze data, create repeatable patterns, and much more.

Artificial intelligence is quite effective when it comes to highly structured tasks requiring a lot of human assistance. Unfortunately, these include

-  Data organization

-  Email sorting

The above two are frequently unpleasant or repetitive activities that individuals wish to avoid.

Augmented AI, however, is better suited for enhancing human intelligence and decision-making tasks. _Augmented intelligence amplification, for instance, can assist you in sorting through a significant volume of data to identify trends and patterns._

**Here are a few details that can really help you distinguish between the two.**

## How does augmented intelligence function?   

**Intelligence augmentation** can help consumer goods companies by gathering data from different sources and presenting it to employees. In this way, employees can completely understand their customers and the industry they're in.

Furthermore, augmented AI can assist in detecting threats and malware that professionals are completely unaware of. Finally, having IA in place allows companies to use information more effectively under the supervision of humans. In this manner, technology does not have complete control over the data.

## Deployment of Intelligence Augmentation:-   

The augmenting human intelligence assessment aids in the adaptation and rapid learning of technology. This essentially means that as time passes, its user benefits greatly. Augmented AI can also help businesses improve customer connections by providing onboarding, customer support, and consulting services. Let us look at a common use case of IA for improvement in several industries.

### Healthcare sector:-   

The healthcare sector is extremely benefited from the ongoing trend of **Intelligence augmentation**. It aids in improving treatment and quality by providing information on how healthcare professionals may improve.

Augmented AI also reduces the numerous chances of medical errors that occur when data points are entered manually by humans. Additionally, it aids in accelerating laborious tasks like invoices, billing, and payment. The core applications of **augmented intelligence** in healthcare and medicine include

-  Error-free and quicker drug discovery with end-to-end research

-  Patient Monitoring

-  Early diagnosis of life-threatening diseases

-  Remote treatments

### BFSI sector:-   

**Intelligence Augmentation** can help various <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/advanced-application-of-ai-in-banking-a-new-era-of-bfsi-sector" target="_blank">BFSI sectors</a> manage and regulate their finances while avoiding common blunders. By utilizing this technology, financial advisors may now quickly customize services that are well-versed in their customers' data needs and risks. This eliminates manual errors, allowing businesses to operate smoothly and efficiently. The most powerful use of **intelligence augmentation** are:-

-  Enriching the client's experiences

-  Initiating precise advisory services

-  Extremely potential fraud detection services

### Manufacturing:-  


Although technology can help reduce the stress of manual procedures in production, human participation is still required.

_Adopting augmented intelligence in manufacturing can aid in the design process. Workers can input parameters, and the machine can design products in a variety of ways_. This increases efficiency by rapidly presenting more design alternatives, and human workers can select the best solutions to provide value to customers.

### Oil and gas:-

The <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/how-to-make-a-rewarding-career-in-the-energy-oil-and-gas-domain-as-a-data-scientist" target="_blank">oil and gas</a> industry has a hugely complex sector with various moving parts involved. Drilling is just one of the processes involved, and getting everything coordinated and running smoothly can be difficult.

The augmented intelligence works to provide a basic environment for optimizing the drilling operations and providing precise coordinates. It constantly helps the worker maintain better operating decisions, helping them to move ahead with less damage and high accuracy.

Many other sectors that mine large amounts of data can benefit from intelligence augmentation. Here are a few examples:

-  Machine maintenance and various forecasting techniques

-  Customer behavior and preferences can be predicted

-  Finding effective treatment alternatives

-  Recognizing market trends

-  Creating choices for autopilot

The options for intelligence augmentation are limitless, and the ultimate goal is to improve all workers' knowledge, skill, and experience. It aims to empower employees to work with machines in order to better grasp and comprehend internet data types.

Furthermore, it aids in risk management during automated decision-making techniques. This enables a more efficient and accurate understanding of complicated processes, which leads to increased productivity and better decision-making.

Finally, we can conclude that Artificial intelligence differs from **intelligence Augmentation** (IA) in various aspects.

Although **intelligence augmentation** is a relatively new concept in the technological domain, it may be used to represent the overall process of human and machine cooperation. Such kind of cooperation ultimately boosts productivity and lowers risk in various tech and non-tech sectors.
