And also, do these courses really help to achieve your desired career growth? This blog will provide more information on the identical.

## The Gradual Advancement of Data Science field

Data science and AI are not new, as we know. When Data Science was first introduced, its focus was mainly on the IT field. As time went by and data science gained an advantage in virtually every field. Gradually it started advancing. Consequently, everyone said that Data Science was bigger than the internet itself. And somehow, it's become true. Now, approx 2.5 quintillion bytes of data generation occur on a daily basis across the world. Every single industry has now converted to the benefits of data science and AI, and so is project management work in the same. _Without analytical knowledge, project managers' jobs will be directed to high risk._ Here lies the importance of <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-ai-for-managers">Data Science courses for managers and leaders.</a>

Data science was induced as a small advancement in technology. It disrupted the market in all sectors, from warehousing to sales and marketing to consumers. It was a massive drive for companies to bloom their businesses, but it was even more massive when it started taking over the operational process in businesses. It took over the machines currently used by companies and forced many businesses to rule out their outdated business methods and update their systems with Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

## Why should you opt to become a data science skill-equipped manager?

According to a <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/analysis-of-data-science-and-ml-job-openings-in-usa-eda-e9191dddef15" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Towards Data Science' Article</a>, at the ending era of 2020, in the USA, the total number of <b><a href="https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/data-science-for-working-professionals" target="_blank">data scientist job</a></b> vacancies was 46.1%, and the lead **data scientist** role was lying at a percentage of 4.1%. But the scenario has changed to a broader extent. At present, In the USA and around the globe, there is a huge vacancy in the lead **data scientist** <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/different-jobs-opportunities-of-data-science" target="_blank">roles</a> and managerial designations.

As of the mid of May 2022, over 72000 lead and managerial openings were available in data science worldwide. At the same time, the vacancies at the junior to moderate level are becoming quite stagnant.

The field of data science is suffering from leadership. So, it's very clear that the study of **data science for managers** and leaders will not disappoint you. If you have 7+ years of working experience, a data science career switch can provide you with a lead role with the best salary and job security. Other alternatives cannot provide this much career security and success.

You might be wondering why I am fragging the topic regarding the importance of data science skills at the manager level instead of coming to the list of top 5 courses. Well, as I told data science courses are spreading like rapid fire. Hence the possibility of getting affected by the wrong course is also becoming huge. So knowing the exact thing about what type of data science knowledge you need or why you need the same at the leadership level will ultimately help you to choose the right course._
