### 1. Content personalization

Manually analyzing the binge-watch rate-building recommendations requires a lot of research and is stressful. Also, it misses the real-time data analysis of momentary visitors. However, whether it's a renowned platform or a newer one, retaining older users and earning new users is quite tough nowadays.

Hence the solution is to generate a promising statistician rate within in-moment users'. Directing the in-moment users into reliable subscribed customers is the only way to survive in this competitive environment. Here comes the extensive need for AI-enabled **hyper-personalization.**
