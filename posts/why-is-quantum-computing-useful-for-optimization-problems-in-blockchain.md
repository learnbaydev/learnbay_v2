The vulnerability of **blockchain** systems in **quantum computing** is one of the problems that is frequently disregarded. **Quantum computers** are one example of how the machines we use continually evolve along with technology.

## What does quantum computing mean?   

**_Quantum computing meaning_** indicates the use of sophisticated machines (quantum computers). Such machines make use of quantum physics to address issues that would be hard to solve using qubits.

_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Qubits</a>_ _can simultaneously represent the values 1 and 0, which offers the potential for a huge boost (optimization) in computer power. Given this, it's crucial to consider the effects of_ **_quantum computers_** _on_ **_blockchain_** _systems and what precautions can be taken to avoid them. Thus quantum computer optimizes problems in the blockchain._

## What is a Quantum Computer?  
  

A quantum computer tends to integrate quantum bits, to perform multidimensional quantum computations. Their processing capacity considerably rises with every qubit that is introduced, as compared to traditional processors that execute diverse programs utilizing bits.

'Classical computers' power improves linearly as more bits are added, but they have much less computational capability than quantum computers.

## Cryptocurrency encryption Breaking:- 

**One of the Most Useful  Quantum Computing Applications**

In order to understand the advantages of quantum computing applications in blockchain (better to say in cryptocurrency), you need concise ideas about quantum hacking.

### What is Quantum Hacking?   

**Quantum hacking** is a real threat to our current asymmetric cryptography system. Millions of people use this worldwide to access things like email and crypto wallets.

Quantum hacking tends to hack and attack any financial institution easily and every login with the phone, which uses _asymmetric cryptography_.'

Thiel is noted as the former director of Utimaco, one of Europe's leading cryptography firms. In order to keep ahead of this potentially devastating threat, Utimaco has been working on post-quantum encryption with Microsoft, Google, and others.

### Can quantum computing really break cryptocurrency encryption? 

The encryption that protects bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is at risk of being broken by **quantum computers**, which use quantum bits or qubits. All of these computers are still in their developing phases and have an incredible potential to extend their computing powers to that of conventional computers.

Despite the fact that quantum computing is still developing, experts already foresee that people who have access to them will be able to steal substantial quantities of cryptocurrency and smart contracts. The capacity of quantum systems to process information far more quickly than conventional computers makes this conceivable.

**_The storage attack_**  _and the_  **transit assault** _are the two main attack types that have the potential to undermine long-standing digital security procedures_.

The storage assault entails breaking into a cryptocurrency and digital currency storage system and taking the stored currencies. The transit assault entails snatching the coins that are being sent during a transaction.

#### Storage Attack:-    

In a storage attack, an adversary targets susceptible addresses. Such targets are those in which the wallet's public key is stored on the blockchain application- to steal cash. There is no use of any private key.

According to <a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/blog/encryption/quantum-security-solutions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">research</a>, 25% of bitcoins are in circulation, with the remaining 65% in the form of tokens on multiple networks, each associated with a public key address. This implies a quantum computer with adequate resources may steal them.

The processing power required to carry out these attacks is estimated to be roughly 10 million qubits. That is much more than the hundred or so qubits we now have. However, scientists believe that quantum computers will reach 10 million in 10 to 15 years.

To circumvent these attacks, fund owners should avoid using susceptible addresses or relocate their funds to addresses where the public key is not publicly available. This is one of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect your assets.

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/wqu-3.jpg" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="A human hand holds a cryptocurrency coin with numerous data analytic insights."/>

This is easier said than done, yet it is the most effective strategy to safeguard your assets.

#### Transits attacks:-

A transit attack occurs when a bad actor with large-scale quantum computers works to hijack an ongoing blockchain work on transferring funds to their address. Because it must be carried out before miners process the validated transaction, this form of attack is more difficult to carry out than others.

Under normal circumstances, this gives Ethereum a few tens of seconds and bitcoin a few minutes.

Because such an intensive attack could require billions of qubits, the risk of transit attacks is lower than that of storage attacks — but it is still worth considering.

And preventing transit assaults is not easy. It necessitates upgrading the blockchain's underlying cryptographic signing mechanism to one resistant to quantum attacks.

### How do quantum computers break blockchain authentication?

The **blockchain** is a database shared among computers in a peer-to-peer network and serves as a public ledger. Hackers find it challenging to access the database's data. This results from mathematical issues that are challenging for a computer to solve.

_Mathematician Peter Shor developed the Shor algorithm in 1994 that enables a quantum computer to quickly find the prime factors of a number and break the encryption._

Numerous aspects of quantum technology are being improved and applied. The development of **quantum computing** is crucial to making future technology much safer. Systems that rely on mathematical algorithms for security are vulnerable to quantum computing but cannot be secure without _<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)</a>_.

## **How can we save blockchain and cryptocurrency technology by quantum computing?**

- Even though <b>quantum computing</b> could endanger blockchain technology, much more research must be done before it can be regarded as a real threat.
  
- When quantum computers are widely accessible, private blockchains & public blockchain technology will probably have evolved and become quantum resistant.

For instance, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, regarded as quantum resistant, is already used in cryptocurrencies like IOTA.

Blockchain developers have a definite advantage over other developers regarding fending off robust computing systems. They can achieve this by boosting the number of digits in the cryptographic keys used to secure the chain—a method that can be scaled more quickly than the attackers' ability to modify it.

## How to become a quantum computing expert?    

In order to become a **quantum computing** expert, you must hold software development knowledge nourished with AI/ML/deep learning skills.

Hence if you are already working as a software developer, you have ample room for your career upgradation. You just need to dedicatedly pursue an industry-level <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/artificial-intelligence-certification-course" target="_blank">artificial intelligence and machine learning course</a>.

Such a course offers proper placement assistance, so if you are passionate about a splendid and future-proof career upgradation, then this is the best choice for you. No need to worry about roaming for a job after the course. Also, this course gives you real-time industry projects and end-to-end training from MAANG experts.
