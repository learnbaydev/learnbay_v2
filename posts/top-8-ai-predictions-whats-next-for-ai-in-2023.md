<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">Find Out the Predictions and Upcoming Trends in Artificial Intelligence</span>

As we start the year 2023, major questions arise regarding the unknown but advanced future ahead for Artificial Intelligence (AI). The previous year was already a significant one for AI-most of the expert **AI predictions** came true. With its adoption in businesses and breakthroughs in technologies such as _NLP (Natural Language Processing)_, one can concur that 2022 was no less than a critical year for AI innovations.

Looking at the benefits that artificial intelligence has offered in recent years, one may conclude that AI offers significant assistance in industries where it can be integrated. Let's take the example of covid prevention, where AI and Data Science technologies have helped stop the spread and minimize the risk.

Since then, it has been at the forefront of many technological advancements, and this year **AI future predictions** are soaring high. However, knowing which advancements will be meaningful for this year is important so that you can advance your AI skills in the same, on priority.

Here are some of my **artificial intelligence predictions** for 2023. These will be based on **current trends in artificial intelligence**, recent events, and future possibilities in the industry. Let's get started.

## 1. We will see some ethical concerns regarding the increase in artificial intelligence implementation.

Artificial Intelligence can show bias at times. This concept may be established from movies like _'I, Robot'_ that show AI incapable of understanding emotions affecting their judging abilities. But, this is a reality as <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/open-ai-chatgpt-is-it-really-a-threat-to-the-humanoid-world" target="_blank">Open AI ChatGPT</a> models are shown to be biased. As the algorithms input human data, they will display biased results.

Being fair in its decision-making capabilities (it's all about <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/what-is-ml-fairness-indicator-all-you-need-to-know" target="_blank">ML fairness</a>) will provide a huge challenge for companies such as OpenAI, DeepMind, etc., working on LLMs (Large Language Models). Some laws are taking place, such as the <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/new-york-city-ai-bias-law-charts-new-territory-for-employers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">New York City AI Bias Law</a> preventing organizations from implementing bias in their AI hiring tools.

It would be exciting to see what innovative solutions the companies come up with.

## 2. We can also see increased regulation.  

This is among the most shocking **AI predictions** for this year.

Due to the problem of bias and wrong information in AI chatbots, governments will likely include some regulatory modifications around these AI models' further development. Companies can be faced with exhibiting detailed records, model history, and reasons for specific predictions made by the model.

This will force the companies to build models with proper governance. According to a <a href="https://www.datarobot.com/newsroom/press/datarobots-state-of-ai-bias-report-reveals-81-of-technology-leaders-want-government-regulation-of-ai-bias/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DataRobot report</a>, around 81% of technology leaders want the regulation to occur. Therefore, we may see an increase in regulatory practice by the governing bodies this year.

## 3. The release of Open AI GPT-4.   

Moving to the technical side, OpenAI is set to release its GPT-4. After the much-hyped ChatGPT release, get ready to look at improved and effective **LLM models**. OpenAI already made plenty of noise last year with ChatGPT and its comparison with the **Google search engine**. This year they will look to match the hype created.

### What to expect from GPT-4?  

While it is not confirmed, the **OpenAI GPT 4** is rumored to feature a multimodal interface. The current OpenAI innovations take only text inputs. However, a multimodal interface can function with text, images, and sounds to interact with humans.

It will be interesting if they go through with it. The **current trends in AI** suggest we may learn more about it sooner. OpenAI's innovations like <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/the-outstanding-evolution-of-dall-e-2-tool-kit-amazing-open-ai" target="_blank">Dall-E 2</a> will also improve, which works with text data as input to produce images.

## 4. We may face a shortage of training data. 

Something that should be discussed more when talking about **AI predictions** for 2023 is the shortage of data the LLMs may face. An effective way to create LLMs with better performance is to train them on more data. However, the training data available on the net for a LLM is finite.

The GPT-4 model may utilize trillions of tokens of data. This amount will exhaust as the estimated amount of data in the world is around 4.6 trillion and 17.2 trillion tokens.

Hopefully, the leading LLM researchers will find a solution to this problem soon.

## 5. More AI investments are to be seen.   

We will now move on to some thrilling **artificial intelligence predictions** that may excite you for the future of artificial intelligence.

Businesses facing supply chain and economic disruptions can benefit from integrating AI to reduce costs and human resources. Industries can scale their productions with artificial intelligence, such as healthcare, <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/artificial-intelligence-in-e-commerce" target="_blank">e-commerce</a>, retail, and manufacturing.

Look forward to seeing more investments in artificial intelligence by these sectors, mainly in financial services, where **AI technology** can improve fraud detection and reduce security risks.

<a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/what-is-generative-ai-all-you-need-to-know" target="_blank">Generative AI</a> (e.g., GPT-4) is set to become a reality sometime in 2023. With software capable of producing meaningful results, they might be used in customer service, new business models, and healthcare discoveries. However, we may expect to see its applications in only experimental use cases by enterprises until the concerns are resolved.

## 6. AI/ML engineers will see a rise in demand.

This is among the best **AI predictions** to come out this year. Many enterprises look to scale artificial intelligence across their business models. This helps them reduce the time and effort required. Therefore, AI/ML engineers' roles will become essential to these enterprises in meeting their requirements.

The industry needs more professionals who can handle the scaling of AI projects and integrate it with other business workflows. According to the **AI trends** this year, we can expect AI and **machine learning engineers** to become mainstream.

It presents many opportunities to grab and hold onto as the competition steadily grows.

## 7. We will finally get driverless cars.  
After much hype around **autonomous vehicles**, we can finally drive in one. It is not fake news, as the <a href="https://getcruise.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cruise app</a> allows its passengers to get from one point to another just by downloading their app and requesting a driverless car.

This is a US-based company, so it only operates in San Francisco. This year, it is also looking to expand to other areas, such as Austin, Phoenix, Miami, and Las Vegas. If this goes according to plan, we will see development in autonomous vehicles in India.
