<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">DSA and System Design- the Key to MAANG/Product-based Company SDE Jobs</span>

**SDE jobs**, aka a **software development engineer role** in a product-based company or in MAANG, is the dream for every single passionate tech guy. But with the increasing openings, **product-based company interviews** for **SDE roles** are becoming harder. In most cases, candidates lack in proper development stack.

The development stack is a topic of concern for every software engineer. We all have a stack we are most comfortable with and stick to. However, it is the responsibility of software development engineers to have other stacks in their minds. Thus in the battle of **software developers vs. software engineers**, the former achieves a winning position in terms of opportunities and salary.

Due to this reason, **full-stack software developers** are now on a massive hike. But the industry secret is SDE with core **DSA, and system design** knowledge is in actual demand in product-based companies.

## DSA and System design- What's it?

The **Data Structure and Algorithm** is a process that is used in **software development**. It is a crucial component of all disciplines involved in software development and is not specific to any one programming language.

_However, the data structure and algorithm process is the cornerstone of the software development process_, while all programming languages change or become obsolete.

The procedures and rules that make up the software development process are used to create software. These procedures aid in directing the creation and use of the software. Following the phases of implementation and testing, the process begins with an analysis and design phase.

No matter what your role is as a programmer, having a strong knowledge of data structures and algorithms is always considered to be important. This is especially true when it comes to any technical interview. If you want to improve your chances of success, ensure you have a solid understanding of topics like graphs.

An another person carrying a large magnifying glass in front of a huge desktop to search for information about the system design process."/>


On the other hand, the **System Design process** is important for tech interviews because many IT companies, such as Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple, ask questions based on System Design concepts for SDE roles. These concepts include scalability, load balancing, caching, and more.

System design is another critical topic within computer science. **_Hence, If you're interviewing for a position in the tech industry, you must brush up on your system design skills!_** 

## What is an SDE role?  

An SDE role in tech is typically a software development engineer position. This position involves creating and implementing software solutions for a company's products or services.

SDEs are responsible for designing, creating, and testing code that meets project specifications.

**An SDE job requires the following skills:**

- An SDE must possess expertise in programming languages, and methodologies,
  
- She/he should be able to collaborate with other members of their development team.
  
- Moreover, SDEs must stay abreast of new technologies and software development trends to continuously hone their skill sets and increase work quality.

## What is the use of DSA and system design in software development engineering in product-based companies?  

**Data structures and algorithms** are essential tools in software development engineering for product-oriented companies.

- Data structures are essential in software engineering as they organize and store information efficiently.
  
- By selecting the correct data structure, developers can improve their applications' performance, reduce memory consumption, and accelerate data processing.
  
- Algorithms are essential tools for solving complex problems and efficiently performing computations.
  
- By selecting the most suitable algorithm, developers can optimize their applications' performance and reduce time-consuming task execution.

**System design** is essential in software engineering as it establishes the overall architecture and structure of a given software system.

- This involves designing various components like modules, interfaces, and data storage mechanisms - all to make the program more scalable, reliable, and maintainable.
  
- With good system design in place, software becomes simpler to develop, operate on, maintain, and upgrade as needed.

_In short,_ **software development engineers** _of product companies or MAANGs utilize data structures, algorithms, and system design to maximize the performance, scalability, and dependability of their software systems in product-oriented companies._

## How to crack product-based company interviews for SDE roles? 

Below are a few of the tips that will surely help you.

- First of all, be patient. Cracking a MAANG (previously FAANG) or any top-notch product company's SDE interview is not a joke. You need to be fully dedicated throughout our learning and <b>SDE interview preparation</b>.
  
- Don't fall into the trap of highly rated free tutorials for <b>data structure and algorithm or system design</b> learning. The industrial direction of DSA and system design are quite tricky. Hence, you always need an expert mentor who can guide you with contemporary trends.
  
- Make your DSA and system design foundation strong.
  
- While choosing a <b>data structure algorithm course</b> or a <b>system design course</b> provides importance to practical learning.
  
- While doing <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/top-5-dsa-projects-for-beginners-in-2023" target="_blank">DSA projects</a>, stick to the following goals
  
  - Choose challenging scenarios as much as you can.
  
  - Do projects based on some current days market requirements. Try to solve the hardest possible bugs with the least possible support from your mentor.
  
  - If you are new to the DSA field, try to master the <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/why-should-you-learn-data-structures-and-algorithms-dsa-in-java-or-python" target="_blank">DSA in JAVA or Python</a> first.
  
  - Before heading to the interview table, ensure that you are adequately confident about your DSA coding abilities.

-  Take at least 3 months for interview preparation. Attend mock interviews as much as possible.

-  If possible, try to indulge in some internships for 2 to 3 months, even if that is unpaid. Only keep in mind that it should provide ample hands-on experience.

_These tips will certainly help you master data structure and algorithms for_ **_product-based company interviews_**.
