The few Important factors that a Full-Stack developer needs to keep in mind are:

1. **Choose a Tech Stack**
2. **Choose Frontend.**
3. **Choose Backend.**
4. **Focus on Database.**
5. **Be a pro of Version Control**

### - Tech Stack     

Every company has its tech stack that they follow. The choice of a stack can depend on various factors like

- Application

- Organization needs,

- product or solution, and much more.

Some tech stacks have become more popular for a few years because of their easy-to-apply features and other capabilities.

The tech stack includes the  **frontend, backend, and database management** technology.

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/full-stack-4.jpg" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An illustrations shows the LAMP stack, such as Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP."/>

### 1. LAMP Stack (It is an old stack, and most of them do not operate this stack much)  

- **L [Linux]** - the open-source operating system foundation for the Lamp stack model.

- **A [Apache]** - A web server delivering web content via the internet.

- **M [MySQL] -** Open-source database scripting language helps construct a website.

- **P [PHP] -** Open source scripting language on the server side.

##

### 2. MERN Stack (For Full-Stack Development)      
- **M [MongoDB] -** A NoSQL database storing data in binary 'JSON' format called 'BASON.'

- **E [Express] -** Backend web application for Node.js. It is used for building and designing web applications easily and quickly.

- **R [React] -** Build user interface by the javascript library.

- **N [Node.js] -** JavaScript runtime environment of the server-side.


### 3. MEAN Stack (For developing applications)   


- **M [MongoDB] -** A Nosql database storing data in binary JSON format.

- **E [Express] -** A backend web application for Node.js is used in rapidly and efficiently building and designing web applications rapidly and efficiently.

- **A [Angular.js] -** A framework that builds single-page user applications using HTML and Typescript (the Typescript libraries you would want to import into your applications).

- **N [Node.js] -** Javascript runtime environment on a server side.

### 1. Frontend stack

It deals with the interface and website that the user gets to see or interact with. The Developer has to innovate and create graphics while designing this. **UI/UX** is a very challenging and crucial task. The primary technology required for frontend development is **HTML5, Javascript, CSS3, jQuery, ReactJs, Angular, etc.**

The front is needed to create a website using a framework that is easy to boot. It is a base for you to build, allowing flexibility in the final design. Few subscriptions contain standardized, pre-written code in folders and files.

### 2. Backend       

A Back-end framework is needed to create applications as it is the script side of the dynamic application.

- **Express.**

- **Django.**

- **Ruby on rails**.

### 3. Database    
We need to retrieve and store data, and we need a database. The two types of databases are (SQL & NoSQL) relational and non-relational.

Developers must be excellent in database management systems like MongoDB, Cassandra, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. In addition, the skill of caching options like Memchand, Redis, and Varnish would be great.

**Few databases are :**

-  **MySQL, SQLite, and Postgres** 

- **VoltDB and MemSQL** 

-  **Cassandra, Sphinx, MongoDB, Apache Storm** 

### **4. Version Control**

Every application receives many version updates and revisions before it is compiled or deployed. A version control system has to be learned along with the usage of software like GitLab, GitHub, and Apache subversion.

## Few Additional Skills To Know    

### 1. SSH

The secure shell (SSH) protocol operates network services securely in an unsecured network. It provides a secured remote login from one server to another with the integrity and privacy of the data.

### 2.HTTPS/HTTP

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) helps define how messages are transmitted and what actions browsers and web servers take when it responds to commands. HTTPS is a secured version of HTTP. The communication protocol is encrypted in Transport layer security, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 3. Linux Command    


(Lovable Intellect Not Using XP)- It is a skill that is not necessary to know or hard to learn. Linux saves a lot of time on the backend by organizing items.

### 4. Algorithms and Data Structure    
Algorithms are a general approach that solves problems and requirements. Every programmer has to know these concepts. It is a different way of storing data. You can see its impact on the application's scalability, efficiency, and performance.

## Summarizing

**Full-stack software/web development** is a vital department of every large or small organization. Many full-stack developers are not as skilled as they would have learned the basics from self-learning courses, coding boot camps, or learning a few old local computing programs. Engineering graduates and working professionals with 1+ years of experience in any domain can apply for <a href="https://learnbay.co/full-stack-web-development-program" target="_blank">Full-stack web development</a> courses and add these top skills to their resumes.

Choose a full-stack web development or a **full-stack software development** to accelerate your career at the fastest pace possible. You can opt for both as you would have already learned different programming languages. You have to work on how the front and back end works with these languages.
