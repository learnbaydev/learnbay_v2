Data Science has already begun to address all of these issues in order to achieve the desired result. As Data Science is now benefiting society, its applications undoubtedly will be more valuable than ever. It will propel the healthcare business forward. Doctors will have a lot of assistance, while patients will have a more personalized experience and treatments.  Let’s look at some of the essential applications in healthcare:
* Predictive analysis: The predictive analysis model generates predictions about a patient’s status. It analyzes various correlations between symptoms, behaviors, and diseases and generates relevant predictions. It also enables healthcare to build predictive models using data science which in turn makes it possible to identify potential risks before they arrive.
* Medical image analysis: Medical imaging is the most common application of the data science healthcare industry. Techniques like X-ray, MRI, and CT scan reveal the inner parts of the human body. With the advent of deep learning, it is now possible to identify the defects in the human body and help doctors in developing successful treatment options.
* Drug Discovery:Today, pharmaceutical industries rely significantly on DS to provide better drugs for patients. They make use of patient information like mutation profiles and metadata to derive insights which in turn helps in the development of models.On the other hand, it is possible to improve drug discovery procedures by collecting historical data.
* Genomics: Before the development of data analysis techniques, genomic research was a time-consuming task. But today Data science in healthcare has made it effortless and easier. Researchers now use DS to study DNA sequences to discover the link between the parameters within it and the diseases transferred by genes.

Monitoring patient health: IoT gadgets are being used by certain patients and clinicians as wearable monitors to track heartbeat and temperature. Data Science in healthcare collects data and analyzes it with the help of data science. Using analytical tools doctors can monitor a patient’s blood pressure, circadian cycle, and calorie intake.



* What is the Role of a Data Scientist in Healthcare? 

Data scientists in healthcare help in exploring ways to predict drug behavior and gain a better understanding of human diseases. 

The primary role of a Healthcare data scientist is to apply all data science techniques to healthcare software and applications. They draw meaningful insights from data to make predictive models. 

In general, the core responsibilities of a healthcare data scientist are as follows:



1. Performing data analysis with various analytical tools.
2. Collection data/ health data. 
3. Analyzing hospital requirements.
4. Organizing and sorting data for use. 
5. Implementing algorithms to extract insights.
6. Building predictive models with the development team.
7. Database management including data collection, retrieval, storage, and security.
8. Converting data into easily digestible chunks for non-technical employees of an organization.
9. Understanding hospital procedures and systems, as well as utilizing data to aid decision-making.
10. Performing information-based audits.
* What skills are required to become a successful data science professional in Healthcare?

The popularity of big data and its potential impact on the healthcare industry has driven the demand for more qualified data scientists. 

There isn’t a “one-size-fits-all” approach to data science. Instead, each role is unique, and because data scientists are in high demand across the healthcare industry, these jobs can require a wide range of talents. 

It is important to build a strong foundation of skills before moving forward based on your interest and strength.



* Mathematics and statistical skills
* Programming languages, <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/introduction-to-python-programming/" target="_blank">Python</a> and R
* Database management languages like SQL and SAS
* Machine Learning and deep learning concepts
* Data visualization
* Quantitative skills and analytical skills
* Communication and presentation skills

While these skills may help data scientists in analyzing the huge amount of data, healthcare data scientists are great at problem-solving and storytelling and are aware of their organization’s objectives. They need to discuss how to leverage data and insights with other data professionals, interact with laboratory staff and also engage with patients.



* Healthcare data scientist and data analyst salaries: What to expect?

Today, Healthcare organizations are investing heavily in <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/differentiating-data-scientist-and-data-analyst/" target="_blank">data science and analytics</a> since it helps them in reducing administrative costs, minimizing fraudulent payments, delivering more accurate treatments and diagnostics, and overall decision making. 

Like any other industry, the salary of a healthcare data scientist is typically determined by qualification, skill set, experience, location, and organization.
