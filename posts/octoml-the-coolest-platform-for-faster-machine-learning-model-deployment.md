## What is OctoML ?

OctoML is a platform for deploying machine learning (ML). It is powered by ML for automation that integrates your model and produces an intelligent/hardware-independent model function.

The most recent innovations allow DevOps and IT operations teams to transform designed <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/model-vs-algorithm-in-ml" target="_blank">machine learning models</a> into flexible, agile, and production-ready software components that connect to already-existing application stacks. When implementing such application stacks, AI-powered applications will make the process more efficient.

Despite the significant impacts that machine learning models and <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/nlp-and-deep-learning-for-data-scientists/" target="_blank">deep learning</a>  approaches are having across the computing field, many challenges still need to be addressed before ML can be implemented into genuine products. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of specialists familiar with the complex software and hardware landscape; this frequently causes product launch delays and overruns in expenditure.

OctoML mainly focuses on making it easier for developers to deploy machine learning models onto various hardware platforms. It aims to enable people to integrate AI into production faster and more efficiently than ever.

OctoML is powered by cutting-edge technology that makes a machine-learning model run faster and smoother on any hardware. They are automating the deployment of machine learning models so that anyone can quickly put them into production.

## Integrating machine learning with Apache TVM:-  

Apache TVM functions primarily as an open-source machine-learning compiler, assisting in the incorporation of powerful deep-learning models into lightweight software. By enabling TVM in machine learning, we can drastically simplify computing models.

Using TVM allows output models to run faster and smoother on a variety of hardware devices, including GPUs and accelerators. Using TVM appears to be a significant term in power and resource management.

You probably already have ML models that have been optimized and compiled with TVM in daily-used apps. Despite its strength, TVM is still sufficiently advanced for widespread use. We seek to democratize effective machine learning while streamlining the use of TVM.

## How does OctoML work?  

The OctoML Machine Learning Deployment Platform is the perfect way to get your proprietary ML models up and running quickly and easily. All you need to do is give the trained models and tell them your desired cloud and hardware target. It will take care of the rest by automatically generating a production-ready accelerated model as per your needs. Here are a few steps given below:-

- A machine learning acceleration professional will get in touch with you when you sign up using the suitable option to get help with platform integration.

- Examine the pre-accelerated models in the platform to observe how they immediately improve performance.

- Utilize the user-friendly interface to accelerate your bespoke model. Realize the performance improvements and cost savings by using them in your environment.

Make portable and practical ML available to everyone using the Octomizer MLops automation platform.

To greatly simplify the modeling, compilation, and deployment processes for data engineers in edge devices and the cloud, strong integration with TVM is really essential. This enables users to

  - _Increase the viability of ML applications by adapting models to the hardware requirements for edge deployment or lowering cloud costs._
  - _Increase the speed of ML model deployment by automating model optimization and packing_
  - _It compares its models to a wide range of hardware targets._
  - _The increased mobility within the two will lessen dependency on specific providers._

## Final thoughts:-  

Here, it is clear that OctoML will significantly simplify the usage of machine learning techniques, especially for non-programmers who cannot write code. In a sense, OctoML may easily sustain improvement with subsequent development, making it easier and more convenient to use in the future.

If you want to keep your career on track, you can also opt for an industrial <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/artificial-intelligence-certification-course" target="_blank">machine learning course</a>. Growing technologies like OctoML are the future of every single business field. No matter if it's core IT or marketing. Stay tuned with machine learning models and technology will be an intelligent decision to secure your future.

Best of Luck.
