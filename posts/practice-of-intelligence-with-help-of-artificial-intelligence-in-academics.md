<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">How Is The Application of AI in Education Revitalizing Academic Sectors?</span>

Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a matter of science fiction films. Instead, it is increasingly becoming a significant part of our everyday lives. We already use tools like Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Google assistance. Far beyond the limits of daily tasks, we have already started experiencing the dream application of **AI in education**.

Just for a quick example, <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuemath</a> offered **AI-powered personalized math and coding training to K12 students.** Moreover, how can we forget the highly advanced **text-to-speech** technology? Using <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/nlp-and-deep-learning-for-data-scientists" target="_blank" >NLP and deep learning</a>, dedicated content translation tools have become quite smarter. In fact, we have even more, like <a href="https://app.questgen.ai/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Questgen</a>, which helps teachers to auto-generate questions for examinations. Hence, whether the students or students or teachers, everyone is getting benefited from the help of artificial intelligence in academics.

With the expected growth of **AI in education** , here is a glimpse into some of the roles it will play in academia.


## 1. Automate Grading:-

Imagine the advancement in teaching once the teachers have assistance in their grading. With AI, the role of a grader can be passed along. Current AI technology is already able to automate the grading of multiple-choice materials. Still, as AI develops and becomes more intelligent, it is expected that the technology will one day be able to grade more than standardized assessments. <a href="https://copyleaks.com/education/ai-grading" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Copyleaks</a> is such an AI-grading tool.

## 2. Create Smart Content:- 

Content is the first thing that determines both the quality and efficacy of teaching. Teachers can now use several smart content generation tools that save massive hours of generating learning material manually.

The top three benefits of using smart content generators are as follows:

- Quick but user-friendly information visualization

- Worry-free and cost-effective digital content generation

- Automatic updates of content in a frequent manner

And yes, all of the above outputs can easily maintain the efficacy of Bloom's Taxonomy. Thus AI helps a lot in **teaching roles**.

## 3. Make The Access and Experience Adaptable:-

Gone are the days when multilingual teaching was a long process. Educators have to spend a lot on translators. Now it's just a matter of a few clicks. Effective use of AI-power translator tools precisely offers multilingual study materials. <a href="https://cuseum.com/blog/2021/4/6/introducing-ai-powered-multilingual-translations" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cuseum</a> is an application that can create and translate copies of learning content with effective accuracy in multiple languages.

Moreover, online learning platforms have already started adapting the applications of **virtual reality (VR) in education**. Students can now visually experience the land of the moon during the study of the soil or environment of the Moonland, and history students can visualize several architectures for in-depth studies. No doubt these give details rich and highly satisfactory **learning experience**.

In addition to helping with grading, AI will also support teachers in other ways. For example, some of the routine tasks can be managed by AI. As well as communication with students. For example, one college professor successfully used an AI chatbot to communicate with students as a teaching assistant all semester without students knowing they were not talking to a human.

### 4. Support Students with More Personalized Touch:- 

Pearson had already suggested that students will have an AI lifelong learning companion in the future. Essentially, this next generation of students will grow up with an AI companion who knows their personal and school history. Therefore, it will know each student's strengths and weaknesses. The use of automated student learning capability and growth analysis tools offers the teacher the scope to deliver highly student-focused **teaching assistance**. The application of a dedicated recommendation engine makes it easy to provide personalized learning recommendations/assessments to the students.

Apart from the above features, AI also provides personalized tutoring for students outside of the classroom. For example, when students need to reinforce skills or master ideas before an assessment, AI can provide students with the additional tools they need for success. And yes, AI-Chatbot can easily help students even beyond classroom hours.

### 5. Meet a Variety of Student Needs (Special education):-   

In addition to acting as a personalized learning companion, AI can also help students with special needs by adapting materials to lead them to success. For instance, studies are already showing positive results for AI teaching ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) students social skills.

### 6. Allow Teachers to Act as Learning Motivators:-   

As AI takes on more of a teaching role by providing students with basic information, it will change the role of teachers in the classroom. Teachers will move into the role of classroom facilitator or learning motivator.

### 7. Identify Weaknesses in the Classroom:-   

AI also works on identifying the weakness of students in the classroom. For instance, AI tools can recognize when groups of students miss specific questions letting the teacher know when material needs to be retaught. In this way, AI also holds teachers accountable and employs best teaching practices.

## What lies beyond?   

There are other advantages to Artificial Intelligence integration in the Education sector.

- AI can help global teaching to be a successful venture for teachers. Teachers can teach students anywhere in the world with the same level of proficiency as a classroom live session. Not only that, but students speaking other languages or having visual/hearing impairments will also benefit from these classes.

- Students with illness may miss a session. This can be negated by the inclusion of AI in schools. Those who can't attend can get easy access to the sessions and learn.

- Some students require a different kind of teaching method than others. This can be made accessible through AI. Those who want to learn the subjects that are not available in their curriculum can have access to their preferred course through AI.

AI will help educators understand their students individually and more efficiently. They can then target them accordingly to enhance their learning process.

## Are human teachers going to be replaced by AI-powered bots?   

Professionals in the core academic field might be worried about this. But the matter of relief is that AI can't replace humans completely. When it comes to teaching, then the possibilities become more void. Effective teaching always needs at least a basic level of human touch. But yes, it's quite obvious that the job roles and eligibility criteria will hugely change for teaching profiles in the near future. Knowledge of AI and ML tools related to digital content management and virtual classes is going to be a must-have eligibility.

## How to make your teaching career future-proof? 

Just to keep your teaching or academic future secure, you must update yourself with <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/advance-data-science-certification-courses" target="_blank">data science and AI</a> skills. It might be possible you are not from any tech or stem background. But to have the basic AI-tools-related knowledge, you need not be an IT pro. Learning a <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-certification-courses" target="_blank">data science foundational course</a> can also help effectively.

Best of luck...
