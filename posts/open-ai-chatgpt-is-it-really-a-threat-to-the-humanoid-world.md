## Know The Future Direction of OpenAI ChatGPT- The Most Discussed AI Wave of 2023

Social media is buzzing with the innovative features of **OpenAI ChatGPT**. The program got over a million users within 5 days of its launch on November 30, 2022. Since then, it has become the next big thing to talk about in the wave of AI innovation.

But how do these AI bots know what to reply to an asked question? They use highly **_advanced machine learning algorithms_** to provide human-like conversations. If you engage in live chats with online chatbots, notice that these AI bots thoughtfully answer questions.

However, new and advanced technologies have taken shape in recent years that use reinforcement learning, conversational AI technologies like **Natural Language Processing** (<a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/nlp-and-deep-learning-for-data-scientists" target="_blank" rel="dofollow">NLP</a>), and **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** to compose meaningful responses. **OpenAI ChatGPT** is nothing but a brilliant implementation of such technologies.

## What is OpenAI ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is an AI-powered system that is used for querying online. The OpenAI chatbot is an auto-generative system that replies to users' questions and answers them accordingly to its knowledge. For such answers, ChatGPT uses its extensive information dataset. It gathers information from textbooks, articles, websites, etc., and uses them to answer frequently asked questions.

OpenAI, the developer of <a href="https://blog.learnbay.co/the-outstanding-evolution-of-dall-e-2-tool-kit-amazing-open-ai" target="_blank" rel="dofollow">DALL-E 2</a>, has developed ChatGPT, along with backing from Microsoft. This is an open-source chatbot framework. However, it is a paid format that offers basic and premium features. **ChatGPT** is the best AI chatbot currently available based on large language models.

**_NOTE_:**

Large language models are deep learning systems that use the knowledge gathered from enormous datasets to recognize, condense, translate, predict, and produce text and other content.

## Various Use Cases of ChatGPT

If used under guidance, it can be helpful in many scenarios. Some everyday use cases that come to mind are contact center employees and customer support teams. These AI-powered chatbots can provide meaningful customer interactions in customer service offices. However, there are other massive usages for **ChatGPT** in different fields. I have listed a few of them below:-

### Coding and Debugging

For programmers, it can help debug their codes and spot vulnerabilities in the code. This is especially useful for freshers whose job relies on finding bugs and refining the existing codes. This model can ease their work and even provide detailed explanations of the bugs to help in the future.

If you're trying to learn programming at first, you might need some external help. It can help you write the whole code by asking the model to do so. You may then analyze the code and understand where you were getting stuck.

### Solving Math Queries

At first, the program wasn't sufficient in solving math equations, but OpenAI made advancements to its programs, making the system able to solve math. In addition, the software can provide explanations to the queries that help students understand the solution and not only copy the answers.

### Grading Test Papers

Teachers can also utilize **OpenAI ChatGPT** in grading their students' test papers. Moreover, it will also assign the grading on a particular essay. Teachers may also look into the detailed explanation of the grading, i.e., the reason for grading the paper with the specific grade.

### Extracting Data

This is a valuable scenario for programmers or someone who understands a little bit of coding. You can write code that can extract specific data from lengthy text to save you some time. For example, if you want to know the mentioned car model, company, and date, write it in the following way.

_‘extract data classes (model, company, date) in simple JSON object.’_

This'll display the result of all the data mentioned above classes within the text.

These were some of the use cases that people running the applications have found. Of course, more uses will appear as its utilization increases, and OpenAI keeps modifying the existing algorithms.

## What are the limitations of ChatGPT?

As with any new technology, **OpenAI ChatGPT** also has some limitations. But OpenAI is continually working on the chatbot platform to enhance customer experience.

It comes with its array of limitations which can be seen below.

- First, as the program’s answers are based on its research from various online sources, it can be biased toward the most supported data. The information on the internet can be biased, manipulated, and incorrect. Since the model does not have ethics instilled, it needs to possess the ability to know what is right or wrong.

- It may offer answers that might be harmful in certain situations. Such as providing the wrong medication for a symptom by searching online.
Here the information may differ for the most accurate result (which might be least circulated across the internet).

- The answers it provides reflect biases and errors, which may be sensitive or controversial. The responses may display misinformation or stereotypes, which would not fit well with specific groups.

- In the case of long-form content generation, mainly for webpages, ChatGPT-generated content can be a red alert. As google search algorithms can easily detect low-quality search engines manipulating AI content. This leads to the degradation of the rank of the concerned website.

## The Future Possibilities…

With the release of OpenAI ChatGPT, competitors in the race tend to create expansive language models that were required to step up their creativity. The GPT software also posed a threat to Google’s search engine. Many consider that this could be the end of Google.

ChatGPT provides direct results to users' queries, such as a baking recipe will display the whole recipe as an answer. It is seen as an improvement to Google's search engine that it displays many results for the query, confusing the reader.

However, it depends on the user intent whether they want specific results or want to research a topic where they will benefit from several different answers.

Even other companies have shown their interest in developing similar large language models. Among Chat GPT's rivals is Olivia, an AI chatbot created by Paradox. Sparrow is another example of an AI chatbot online.

Created by DeepMind researchers, Sparrow is seen as the best AI chatbot to improve upon ChatGPT's ethical drawbacks. It has incorporated ethical rules since its beginning.

## Google Vs. ChatGPT

Microsoft could potentially include ChatGPT in its search engine Bing to challenge its rival Google’s search engine. However, there are many issues they would have to face, one of which is discussed above.

DeepMind is a Google subsidiary. These could contribute to Google's response to the OpenAI ChatGPT problem. With Google planning to launch 20 new AI innovations to challenge ChatGPT, it can be seen how seriously Google tech heads are taking ChatGPT. According to CNBC, Google’s AI-powered search engine ‘Apprentice Bard’ improves ChatGPT’s drawbacks.

- As Google has a massive repository of information available, it enhances the capabilities of its search engine to present accurate information to users. This is an improvement in the search capabilities of ChatGPT.

- Apprentice Bard uses LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications), Google’s conversational technology solution. This model can answer questions in a more timely manner than that of ChatGPT through real-time answering mechanics.

- The Google search engine can answer your questions about recent events, which is not a feature in ChatGPT as its data limit is till 2021.

## Final Verdict

OpenAI ChatGPT is an exciting application that offers many possibilities. If you can use it for your benefit appropriately, then it is an excellent modification to an already advanced area, i.e., large language models.

If you are interested in such applications, learn about machine learning algorithms and NLP behind it. In addition, you may pursue a project about the same to understand the intricacies, and it can also act as an excellent addition to the resume.
