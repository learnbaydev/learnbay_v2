<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px"> Know The Advantages of AI Blockchain in Managing the Threatening Environmental Factors </span>

As we all know, blockchain is primarily used in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin to the back end of the entire business, but environmental researchers are utilizing blockchain technology differently in novel ways that could ultimately save the planet as we know it.

It's not all about reducing carbon footprints. So many other things are there where AI blockchain (combined applications of AI and Blockchain)take a step ahead to maintain and manage climate change.

In addition to assisting businesses in reducing their carbon footprint by providing reports to their clients on how environmentally friendly they are, AI blockchain is now being used to monitor pollution more effectively than ever before.

Because of blockchain technology, an industry's distinct efforts can be combined into a networked effort. Eco-technology firms leverage this to build platforms that enable businesses, governments, and individuals to collaborate and earn profit from the significance of platforms built by Eco-technology startups that are blockchain-enabled.

## How many people would wonder how it would work?

AI Blockchain's decentralized methodology offers both depth and breadth analysis. It deals with several issues, while at the same time, it's available to everyone and enables people to review and report on many different problems. Additionally, it enables the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emission reductions across the whole supply chain, including all parties involved in the production, distribution, and customers wishing to purchase goods or services from them.

Having accurate and open attribution of climate data is the most crucial precondition for creating effective climate change programs and policies. Blockchain technology can be useful here. Its capacity for data tracking and sharing securely suggests that it has the potential to have a big impact on how climate change is dealt with.

## Why Blockchain?  

Blockchain as a source of data can impact global climate governance, one that's been talked about in previous years. It has the potential to ensure a platform for cooperation through its ability to store secure and tamper-proof information. This makes it possible to upload usable data concerning climate change solutions, making it more accessible while sharing valuable information with nations worldwide.

Systems are now being developed to boost the adoption of renewable energy sources. Blockchain technology can also be applied in sustainable and environmentally smart supply chains where products can be tracked from their blueprint design phase through to their utilization by both customers and manufacturers alike. This ensures that a product will not end up causing any inefficiencies or waste that could potentially contribute to how it had been produced, destroying the environment.

## The following specific strategies could employ blockchain technology for climate action:-

### A preferable carbon emission trading system:-  

A more transparent method of managing carbon assets can be implemented using blockchain technology. Blockchain transaction records cannot be altered if specific requirements didn't meet. As a result, adopting Blockchain to record carbon assets will guarantee that business transactions are legitimate and binding. This service may be provided via a blockchain platform since it would guarantee that all legitimate transactions occurred in a verifiable and permanent manner.

### Climate finance flow:-   

Blockchain technology might be used to finance initiatives. It allows you to get funds from outside your country and is a more effective approach to managing the resources you have to pay for new endeavors. Blockchain technology and crowdfunding can help make peer-to-peer financial transactions that support climate action.

### Trading in green energy:-

Blockchain technology may also make it possible to create platforms for peer-to-peer trade in green energy in addition to the benefits already highlighted. Through exchanges of tokens or other tradeable digital assets that correspond to a specific amount of physical energy produced, consumers would be able to buy, sell, or trade green energy with one another.

### Avoiding double counting and improving tracking and reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction

The idea of transparency is crucial for business owners because it makes it easier for the team to see failures and triumphs. Both businesses and customers are subject to this. A business can gain from analytics and metrics to increase transparency in its products or services so that it can keep improving every day while being aware of any persistent issues with customer feedback or ideas. The system would increase openness, simplify the tracking and reporting of carbon emissions, and lower the possibility of double-counting mistakes.

## Advantages of Blockchain in climate change:-

*  **Blockchain in Data Management:-**

AI blockchain is a new form of data management technology that is decentralized and open. Because of this, it can improve governance in terms of how resources are handled and distributed. We should take full advantage of the technological advancements that Blockchain provides countries struggling with humanitarian crises. Such crises usually form due to natural disasters or man-made destruction. By leveraging its level of transparency, sustainability could be improved within institutions aiming to help people find solutions for climate change-related problems.

* **Blockchain in sustainable development:-**

Researchers working at the nexus of Blockchain and sustainable development will keep studying ways to apply Blockchain more broadly in industries that can help mitigate the causes and consequences of climate change in the years to come. As a result, sustainable development related to climate control will greatly benefit private investments, boost efficiency, and decrease transaction costs.

*  **Blockchain in resource management:-**

Blockchain technology can reduce inefficiencies and resource waste. In reality, the technology can help improve resource management by tracking supply chains. Customers will better understand how their things were created and distributed because of Blockchain's openness, enabling them to choose ecologically responsible options that are good for society and the environment.

## How can AI Blockchain be proven so effective?     

Many organizations are already working on blockchain-based recycling programs. As an illustration, The Plastic Bank, a company, uses IBM cloud computing and blockchain technology to develop a program that can be used to generate revenue from ocean plastic.

By successfully establishing collecting sites around developing nations, Plastic Bank's sustainability mission converts plastic waste into money. In exchange for various incentives, including cash benefits, phone charging, and other perks, people can deposit their used plastic in this system. The company is now developing a blockchain-based application that will let consumers trade their plastic for cryptographic tokens.

## Final Thought:-   

As we have seen the use of blockchain technology in overall climatic changes, we can easily deduce that Blockchain can surely help supply chain management and keep the data secure. With further development, it will surely help sustain the environment in a vast and manageable way. Here are a few points we have covered on blockchain technology helping in climatic change.
