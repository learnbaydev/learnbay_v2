<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px"> Come! Let's find out how Python can help you locate a job and why it is the programming language to focus on. </span>

So, you've chosen to study the Python Programming Language. But where should you start? Should I learn Python first or Java? Given that Python and Java rank first and third, respectively, among the most applied programming languages. Or you might be wondering if learning Python is still worth it. Don't worry because this blog answers every question you might have when starting with Python.

Did you know Python development services are employed by companies such as Instagram, Facebook, Uber, etc., in powering their top systems and applications? As a result, industries need skilled Python developers who can effectively evolve their coding and programming to fit the current market.

Without any further delay, let's dive into the introduction to Python programming.

## What exactly is Python?

Python is a general-purpose, interpreted, and dynamic programming language that belongs to high-level programming language divisions. It is commonly used for application development because it supports an object-oriented programming approach.

## Why is Python so well-liked?  

A simple one-line response would be that it is 'widely accessible and has a 'simple syntax'. Yes, not a single programming language has the same accessibility and ease of use as Python. Python's syntaxes give natural language a lot of weight, making it easier to understand and work with and sound more like human communication language. As a result, it has stayed in the top five programming languages preferred by software engineers, application developers, and other techies for the past few decades.

But, since the last few years, crossing the circumference of popularity, Python has become a global craze irrespective of demographic, professional, and generation-related limitations.

## Why should you learn Python in 2023?  

Python programming is now the fifth fundamental need for developers to live in this real world, after food, water, air, and shelter.

It may sound diplomatic or even crazy, but it's a fact. So let's look inside at why learning Python is essential.

### Use of Python is industry-independent

Every industry needs Python. Most industries like BFSI, healthcare, sales and marketing, and even education and research are becoming highly dependent on python programming. The example given here will certainly make you realize how powerful Python programming language is.

Skilled growth marketers, who once relied solely on simple analytical skills and advanced Excel expertise, now have little value in the marketing industry unless they know Python. So yes, nowadays, python-driven research is used to make most growth marketing decisions. As a result, Python is embedded in every area of the industrial sector, regardless of domain.

**But why this sudden popularity?**

### Python is a foundational language of data science  

**Data Science-** the primary cause of Python's cross-industrial demand surge.

Initially, R used to be the backbone of data science. Still, with the advancement of data science and its applicability, the complexity of R became a sound barrier for the data science field. Simplicity and a more comprehensive range of accessibilities promoted Python as the successful replacement for R in data science.

With the advancement of <a href="https://www.learnbay.co/artificial-intelligence-certification-course" target="_blank">AI and Machine Learning</a>, Python achieved more credibility within the last few years. The most widely used software and application packages like 'pandas', 'NumPy', 'Matplotlib', 'pyspark', 'Keras', 'Scikit-learn', 'PyTorch', etc., all are developed using python programming. Such applications and libraries are very efficient for handling more significant amounts of data, even by non-programmers.

As these are inbuilt libraries within Python, no core programming or coding proficiency is needed besides the application usage knowledge. These applications have strong algorithmic abilities, making a person with only a basic understanding of statistics and complex mathematics impressively eligible to do a data analytics job. This is why Python is called 'A programming language built for everyone and is making the future of data science'.

### It's going to be the most demanding skills in the future job market   

While data science has become the hottest topic in the global job market, the demand for python programmers is increasing silently. Why so? Well, everybody is now focusing on the data science career switch. Professionals without technical backgrounds target the basics of python programming and jump into the data science tools and technologies.

**But from where are these tools and technologies coming?** Yes, these are the output of so many python programmers' hardships. Hence, while the key focus is now on data scientist and data scientist courses, the hidden job opportunities are very high for python programmers. On LinkedIn.com, at present, almost 528,242 python jobs are available worldwide. The number is increasing by at least 10% every day.

So, you hold a technical background or are a student. In that case, it's best for you to focus on earning experience (for working professionals) or degrees in core python programming (for students).

Python programmers are well compensated. They earn around 7 to 18 lakhs/year (6 to 10 years of experience) as base salary with additional compensation of almost the exact amounts in India. This is relatively high in comparison to other programming developers like PHP, Java, C++, etc. Even SMEs offer an average 2 to 3 lakhs salary package to freshers.

## What are the uses of python Software?   

Python software can be used in various ways, as previously mentioned. The fields and tasks for which python software is widely used are listed below.

- Web development
- 3D CAD application
- Machine learning
- Scripting
- Data Analysis
- Processing of image
- Artificial Intelligence
- Speech Recognition
- Development of Software
- Data mining
- Creation of Desktop and mobile application
- Development of Games

## Features of Python   


- **It's simple to understand, read, and write.**

Syntaxes used in python programming are more like natural language/ human language (like English). So, for example, to print 'Learnbay- The Data Science & AI Institute, 'we have to type print("<a href="https://www.learnbay.co/" target="_blank">Learnbay</a> â€“ The Data Science & AI Institute") in python editor or any IDLE.

- **Smart in memory management.**

Python offers you a stress-free programming experience concerning memory. Moreover, this programming software comes with efficient auto-memory management features that periodically clean the memory.

- **Free to use and open source.**

No purchasing or subscription cost is required for downloading and using Python. You can use Python at zero cost for a lifetime. Moreover, due to its open-source licensing features, you can share this software, among others. You even can modify the source code as per your project requirement.

- **Cross-platform performance.**

Python has compatibility with most operating systems like Windows, Linux, Mac, Unix, etc. But, until now, you have learned plenty of basic information about python programming. You might have a question in mind when you know the ease of use.

## Real-world examples of Python programming language:-   

1. **Instagram:** They utilize Python in almost all of their projects. Instagram's social platform for photo-sharing uses Django, a Python framework. This can also modify their framework when they want without any technical errors.

1. **Netflix:** Netflix is the most popular streaming service that employs Python in some of its projects. Regional failover is one impressive example in which the Outage Time is decreased, from 45 to 7 minutes, without any extra cost. Other projects include Chaos Gorilla, Chronos, Central Alert Gateway, and Security Monkey.

## In Conclusion  

**Can I learn Python on my own?** Yes, of course. Plenty of python learning videos are now available over the internet. A few reliable options are Codecademy, Learnpython.org, and LinkedIn python learning courses, and you can download Python for free <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here.</a>

These are only for gathering an essential stage of knowledge. If you have data science career transition planning, you must choose a creditable course featured with real-time industrial projects.
