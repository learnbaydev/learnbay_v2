## Create an Attractive Full Stack Portfolio - Tips and Tricks

Understanding the frontend and backend frameworks can easily help you build applications independently. You even have an impressive resume with your technical expertise and unique talent. But still lags in getting the desired full stack developer job profile. What you're missing is a full stack web developer portfolio.

In interviews, your full stack portfolio is more essential than your resume. You can showcase your skills and experience as a developer through a resume, but a portfolio helps validate them. Portfolios help gain a recruiter's attention. They can quickly assess your skill level and evaluate whether you're the right candidate for the job profile.

Relevant problem-solving skills should be highlighted in your portfolio. Recruiters can find out how you've used your skills in the past to solve various problems.

Creating an attention-seeking portfolio is a difficult yet crucial task. You might not get the desired results from your portfolio until you learn how to build a full-stack portfolio with the right tactics.</br></br>

**First, let us define what a full-stack developer portfolio entails.**</br></br>

## What is a Full Stack Developer Portfolio?

It is a detailed web page or document that displays your projects. A portfolio shows your work experience, skill sets, and personality to a potential recruiter. It is something that defines your capability as a candidate in an interview. Therefore, your portfolio should look very impressive to a recruiter.</br></br>

## How Does A Full Stack Web Developer Portfolio Look?

An excellent portfolio must possess some characteristics that make it appealing. Make sure you customise your portfolio to meet the criteria below:-</br></br>

### 1. Create a concise copy of your portfolio

Write a short, to-the-point description of your work that grabs the attention of recruiters. They generally search for meaningful information in web developer portfolios to keep it clear and easy to read. Only include valuable information, such as the web development language and tools used, as a problem-solving approach for the viable outcome.</br></br>

### 2. Optimise for quick loading time

If your portfolio takes a long time, the recruiter might lose interest and move on to the next candidate. It also displays your knowledge of the back end, and when your portfolio site is optimised for faster loading time, it might impress the recruiter.</br></br>

### 3. Include relevant project samples

Optimize your work samples according to the job requirements. Choosing relevant projects will catch a recruiter's attention faster. You can also choose some challenging projects that improve your skills and exposure. We will discuss the projects a bit in the **'How to build a full stack web developer portfolio'** _section in detail._ </br></br>

### 4. Design the portfolio:-

Your portfolio should also appear as fascinating as your resume. It does not need to have a professional-looking design. Just create a portfolio you like and show the recruiters your creative skills. </br></br>

### 5. Attach proof of results:-

Validate your portfolio projects with proof from past employers, published materials, recognitions, or prizes you have attained. It will add authenticity to your portfolio.</br></br>

### 6. Include a better communication channel:-

Provide a way for recruiters to contact you through Email, LinkedIn, or a personal number. Everything else is meaningless if the recruiters can't contact you when it is required.</br></br>

## How to Build a Full Stack Web Developer Portfolio

### 1. Short introduction

Start with a brief and catchy introduction to your portfolio. It should describe your skills and how you've utilised your talents. A short description of yourself should help recruiters gain details about your professional background.</br></br>

### 2. The "About Me" section

While it's unnecessary to include, as your resume does the required work, if you do include a comprehensive "About Me" section, go into detail about your experience and skills. You can provide additional data about your certifications, past work, or educational background.

Simultaneously, you may add tools, frameworks (Ruby on Rails, etc.), languages (HTML, CSS, and Javascript), and soft skills in an easy-to-understand manner.</br></br>

### 3. Best Projects

This is the section that will be of most interest to recruiters. So remember to impress them with your work samples. Mention all the details of the projects you noted and try to make them presentable so readers can easily understand them.

You may mention individual projects, college-level projects, open-source freelance work, and project samples from your past employers. Ensure you adequately describe the problems tackled in the project, the measures you took to solve these problems, and the tools or programming languages you used in the development process.</br></br>


## What are the main points that must be highlighted in a CV?

- Highlight some of the most relevant projects you worked on. Make sure you update the projects relevant to your employers. You should also mention the projects completed for prominent employers that attract companies' interest.

- Keep formatting easy and straightforward. Recruiters should easily navigate through the pages, so make sure you include one sample project on a single page.

- Detailing is an essential fact in your projects. Include all the relevant information, such as project goals, findings, and conclusions. If you worked with a team, mention your role in the team as well. </br></br>

## What are the important steps to building a full stack developer portfolio?

To create a portfolio that stands apart from others, use the following tips:

- Choosing a third-party host for your webpage portfolio makes it look less appealing to recruiters. Full stack web developers can self-host their web pages. You may also use any of the several hosts that are available for low cost.

- Reinforce your skills and projects. It means mentioning the skills you acquired while completing your projects, such as project management, problem-solving, analytical thinking, etc.

Also, mention what type of projects you are interested in working on in the future, as recruiters will get more information about the candidate you are for their business.</br></br>
